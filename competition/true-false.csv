70,Will there be any publicly disclosed cyber attacks on nuclear facilities before the end of 2016?,"['yes', 'no']",no,G113,"In making this decision, the question team carefully reviewed the open source evidence of three different incidents. The first two incidents were reviewed when the initial news broke and again at the end of the year. The third was considered when the 2016 report from the Nuclear Threat Initiative was released. The first incident was the discovery of malware in a German nuclear power plant in May 2016. At the time, there was insufficient evidence to close question because it was unclear whether the malware was introduced into the system as part of an attack or if it was introduced inadvertently. A clarification relaying this decision was issued at that time. Although NTI counts this incident in their 2016 report (NTI), they present no new evidence about the incident and also go on to classify the intent of the act as ""unknown"" rather than as ""intentional"" or ""accidental."" With no additional evidence on how the malware was introduced, our decision in May remains unchanged. The second incident involved the release of data from a hydrogen isotope research center in Japan. In June, it was revealed that a PC at the facility was infected with a virus in November of 2015 and subject to remote control until late December 2015. Data from the research center was released in March and June of 2016, during the question's open period (Japan Times). It is unclear whether all the data was stolen in 2015 and released in 2016, or if some of the released data was acquired by the perpetrators during 2016. However, sources agree that the November 2015 spearfishing attack was what enabled the data to be stolen (Japan Times, eSecurity Planet), and because the spearfishing attack occurred prior to the question’s open period this incident does not qualify. The third incident was the at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission/Department of Energy and is listed in the NTI report with a February 2016 date, but the perpetrator of the incident was indicted for these actions in the spring of 2015, so the attack occurred prior to the question's open period (FBI). Given the clarification issued in May and the lack of subsequent evidence, there is insufficient evidence to close this question as ""yes"" based on the incident at the German power plant. The attack on the Japanese power plant began in 2015, prior to the question's open period, and so does not qualify, as did the Department of Energy incident. Threats emanating from the cyber realm have been increasing in frequency and severity. In just the last month, we saw Russia sanctioned for using cyber to disrupt elections, Kiev's power grid turned off after a cyber attack, and a huge merger put in jeopardy after Yahoo revealed that millions of its accounts had been hacked. The unique nature of the cyber domain creates challenges for adjudicating forecasting questions using open source material and requires that these questions be less precise than others you'll find on the site but given the growing importance of this threat, it is worth working through this ambiguity so that the Good Judgment forecasting community can engage on these issues and the wisdom of the crowd can be leveraged. We will be launching an open question next week to solicit your ideas on what questions we should be asking about this important topic and also how we should be asking those questions. We hope you will share your thoughts and continue to engage on the important issues of the day here at Good Judgment Open.

For example, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against banking websites-while widespread-would cause only temporary disruption of Internet access to customer's bank accounts. They would not affect customer account balances or other banking services such as ATM withdrawals, nor would they disrupt the larger financial system, although the affected banks would incur losses because of the mitigation and other costs. Moderate-Level Cyber Attacks create localized, nonpersistent disruption to core functionality of critical services and functions but do not generate substantive systemic or national-level effects. For example, a cyber-attack that disrupted a single power plant for a couple of hours-equivalent to a temporary local power outage from a snow storm-would qualify as a moderate-level cyber attack. High-Level Cyber Attacks disrupt critical infrastructure services and generate substantive systemic or national-level effects over an extended period of time. For example, a cyber attack that reduced oil pipeline transport across a key region and resulted in a spike in national oil prices over the course of a month would qualify as a high-level cyber attack. Catastrophic Cyber Attacks affect the fundamental viability of core government, military, or economic services or functions; or cause significant loss of life or widespread property damage. For example, a cyber attack against critical infrastructures that caused an economic depression would qualify as a catastrophic cyber attack. A US entity can be governmental, commercial, academic, nonprofit or an individual. For the question to resolve as 'yes', the government of North Korea must sponsor or execute the attack.

The Standard Model of particle physics, General Relativity, quantum and classical mechanics, and most extant proposed extensions of these theories are ""unitary,"" meaning that all of the information in a system at some time can in principle be recovered from the same system at a later time, by running the laws of physics ""backwards."" Black holes appear to be a possible exception: Hawking's calculation of black hole evaporation predicts an information-free spectrum of radiation emitted, no matter what was thrown into the black hole. Whether black holes violate unitary -- as claimed by Hawking -- has been fiercely controversial for decades. In 2004, Hawking conceded that unitarity is preserved, based on arguments related to the AdS/CFT correspondence. But even if this verdict is accepted, there is no widely-accepted explanation of how unitarity is preserved in detail, or how information actually escapes a black hole during evaporation. In September 2015, Hawking claimed in a short paper to have made a breakthrough on this topic, and presented his ideas at a meeting, which also involved extensive discussions with eminent relativists Andy Strominger and Gary Gibbons. The central claim is that ""the information is stored in a supertranslation associated with the shift of the horizon that the ingoing particles caused."" Is this the key to unraveling the paradox? The question will be resolved as ""yes"" if, by November 15, 2016, both Hawking's paper receives more than 100 citations, and any two of Leonard Susskind, John Preskill, and Raphael Bousso make statements in writing that the information paradox is essentially solved, and that the solution can be cast in terms of supertranslations defined on the horizon.","['Physical Sciences – High Energy Physics', 'Physical Sciences – General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'Physical Sciences – Quantum Mechanics', 'Research Impact', 'Scientific Discoveries']"

A prototypical quantum computer is composed of N ""qubits,"" or quantum mechanical bits. Keeping these qubits operating as a closed system that retains its quantum character (without ""decohering"" via interactions with the environment) is a difficult challenge for more than a handful of qubits.

Conversely, difficult questions regarding how conscious or mental activity is related to brain activity (the so-called ""hard problem"") have led some to suppose that this mystery may be related to puzzles involving quantum mechanics. Penrose, for example, has argued that the mind/brain cannot be modeled as a classical device, and that quantum effects are integral to thought. If the brain really acts as a quantum computer, then it should presumably contain quantum systems sufficiently isolated from their environment to retain their essential quantum nature, rather than decohering into effectively classical systems. This is a challenge in the warm, wet environment of the brain, where studies have calculated that quantum states of electron-based systems should decohere in a tiny fraction of a second. On the other hand, if quantum effects are potentially useful, the evolutionary drive toward high optimization is likely to have exploited them. And indeed, there is good evidence that quantum effects are employed in photosynthesis and some other biological processes. Recently, a provocative paper by well-known physicist Matthew Fisher has appeared arguing that the nuceli of atoms are sufficiently isolated from the brain environment that nuclear spins could be used to store qubits, and manipulation of certain compounds could instantiate quantum computation. The paper proposes several experiments that could help validate or refute the hypotheses it puts forth.

A related result due to Turing proves that the halting problem (of determining whether a general computer program will halt or run forever) is undecidable in that no Turing Machine exists that can solve it. Though of deep importance in mathematics and theoretical computer science, these results have generally been considered to have few if any implications for physics, and by extension the natural world. (Though see this result in classical physics, and the extended discussions by Penrose, Chaitin, Barrow, Tegmark and Aaronson.) A fascinating new result by Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, and Wolf (CPW; see Nature paper and infinitely long arXiv paper) suggests that the implications may be stronger than previously thought. They prove that in certain idealized quantum systems, the existence of a finite energy ""gap"" between the ground state and first excited state is formally undecidable. They moreover prove that as the number of lattice sites L increases toward infinite, a gap may appear and/or disappear at values of L that are undecidable. This result potentially calls into question standard operating procedure in many quantum many-body physics problems. However, its applicability to realistic physical systems is as yet unclear, calling for further work.

(2015) -- The serendipitous discovery of a possible new solar system object with ALMA The Vlemmings et al. object, which the authors of the paper have named ""Gna"", was observed in the sub-millimeter continuum at 345 GHz. It has properties that are consistent with either a Centaur-like minor planet at a roughly Uranus-like distance of 12 to 25 AU, or more intriguingly, with a large rogue planet traversing the the solar system at ~4,000 Earth-Sun distances.

It’s unlikely that the wildly successful New Horizons Mission would have gotten its congressional funding approval if Pluto had never held the status of a named planet.

He tried to increase his odds of patronage by naming his new moons “The Medicean Stars” in reference to Cosimo II de’ Medici, fourth Grand Duke of Tuscany.

785,By the end of 2017 will a gene drive targeting malaria be initiated?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M44,"""Gene drives"" are phenomena in a species' population in which one version of a gene, or allele, is probabilistically favored over other alleles that are otherwise equally favored by fitness. A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes engineered gene drives tractable: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being ""driven,"" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one ""wild"" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited. This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival. Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. Valentino Gantz et. al. have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another study published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated engineering mice (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease. With Malaria afflicting hundreds of millions of people per year, advances in gene drive research have insitgated public conversation about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives is being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems. By January 1st, 2018, will a formal submission be made to a regulatory body proposing to test a malaria-combatting gene drive in a wild population?","['Biological Sciences – Bioengineering', 'Series — Playing God', 'Biological Sciences – Evolutionary Biology', 'Biological Sciences – Ecological and Environmental Biology']"
786,"In 2016, will an AI player beat a professionally ranked human in the ancient game of Go?","['yes', 'no']",yes,M45,"The game of Go originated in China more than 2,500 years ago. While similar to chess in many ways, Go is much more minimalist in its ruleset and more esoteric in strategy. The aspect of pattern recognition and the huge state space of possible moves in Go (vastly greater than chess) make it an excellent metric for the capabilities of artifical intelligence. Many computer Go players have been developed, and the University of Electro-Communications (UEC) in Japan has held annual cups that pit AI vs. AI in games of Go to determine the strongest computer player. A five-year agreement was made in 2012 to grant the AI victors of the UEC cup additional matches against highly ranked human Go professionals. These are called Densei-sen, or ""electric Sage battles,"" made to test the AI's effectiveness against human opponents. The Crazy Stone go engine, created by Rémi Coulom, beat Go Sensei Norimoto Yoda in the second Densei-sen competition at the UEC. However, Crazy Stone was granted an extremely generous handicap of a four-stone advantage at the start. Many other computer Go players exist, including ones in development by AI giants like Facebook and Google DeepMind, but none have beaten a professionally ranked human player without a handicap. The next UEC cup is in March 2016 and many prominent AI teams have already registered, including Crazy Stone and Facebook AI's own darkforest. Additionally, Google's Demis Hassabis has implied a new breakthrough in Go artificial intelligence. With Computer Go getting more and more powerful, an AI player beating a Go master is a real possibility. This question is positively resolved if, in 2016, an AI with no handicap beats a professional human player in an official game of Go.","['Technological Advances', 'Computing – AI – Human vs AI gaming', 'Computer Science – AI and Machine Learning', 'Computing – Artificial Intelligence']"

The goal of such research is to understand the natural pathways by which existing wild pathogens may become more dangerous, so as to enhance our ability to respond, to create better vaccines, etc. However, there are obvious potential dangers as well, as an accidental release, or deliberate theft of such organisms could create a potential pandemic; even the information published about such efforts could increase the probability of bioterror or bioerror events. In October 2014, the White house issued a funding pause on such experiments involving influenza and coronaviruses, partly in response to a statement by the Cambridge Working Group that called for a curtailment of experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens in the laboratory, pending a risk and benefit assessment.

At last count, NASA's Kepler Mission has generated 4,696 high-quality planet candidates, and thousands more are on the way from NASA's K2 and TESS Missions. The surge in the planetary census has been almost exclusively driven by transit detections, in which the parent star is observed to undergo a subtle once-per-orbit dimming when a planet passes directly in front of the stellar disk. Until recently, the Doppler velocity technique was the most productive method for discovering new planets. With the Doppler method, one monitors the shift in the parent star's line-of-sight velocity as it travels around the star-planet center of mass, thus allowing the presence of an unseen planet to be inferred. The Doppler velocity technique works very well for massive planets that have short-period orbits. When the magnitude of the velocity shift lies below 1 meter per second, however, it becomes very difficult to make secure detections. Recently, a number of high-profile, front-page discoveries have been called into question.

Basic physics makes such phenomena difficult: the electromagnetic repulsion between two nuclei generally prevents fusion unless there is very high energy given to at least one of them, which suggests a very high temperature. However, that does not mean such processes are physically impossible. For example, ""pycnonuclear reactions"" can occur at zero temperature and ultrahigh density, muons can catalyze fusion at low temperatures, and the right system can accelerate particles at low temperature up to MeVs over a millimeter. The possibility of cheap unlimited energy has motivated several groups to pursue the possibility of ""Low Energy Nuclear Reaction"" (LENR) energy production. As featured in a previous question, for the past 4 years, Andrea Rossi has been claiming to make large amounts of heat in his various ""E-Cat"" reactors, apparently inexplicable in terms of chemical reactions. A somewhat similar LENR project is led by Robert Godes, who runs the company Brillouin Energy. These efforts have generated several websites such as this one tracking news in the field.

The design calls for a pod in a low-pressure tube system; the pod rides on a cushion of air to eliminate friction with a track, and the low-pressure tube dramatically reduces air drag. The resulting design could achieve speeds near 760 miles per hour, taking passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 35 minutes. Compare that to the California High Speed Rail (CHSR) project, still under construction, which aspires to make the same journey in just under three hours at around a quarter of the speed. Musk proposed the Hyperloop as not just a more ambitious and futuristic alternative to CHSR; Hyperloop aspires to be safer, cheaper, and self-powering. After initial skepticism, a consensus emerged that the Hyperloop idea is credible, and rather rapidly, several independent efforts to develop the Hyperloop concept began. At present, teams from the U.S. and abroad are preparing to present their own Hyperloop designs at the [design weekend] at Texas A&M University. Top designs will be tested at the SpaceX test track (also in construction) in California. Meanwhile, the other two prominent hyperloop companies, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop Technologies Inc. (HTI), compete to create their own Hyperloops; these will be operational at subsonic speeds, far below 800 mph but still faster than the CHSR projected speed. This means that prototype hyperloop technology may be demonstrated by one or more organizations as early as 2016. The basic requirements that we'll use to define a Hyperloop are as follows. A pod or capsule in a tube of at least 2 m 2 cross-section, suspended in an environment at pressures less than 1000 Pascals.

This world, tentatively dubbed ""Planet Nine"", is predicted to have a mass ten times that of Earth, an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a large eccentricity (e~0.6). The evidence for Planet Nine is indirect, and is based on alignments of known Kuiper Belt objects that are very difficult to explain through simple chance occurrence. In essence, the presence of the new planet is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. The current distance to Planet Nine is likely about a thousand times the Earth-Sun distance, and so if it exists, it is quite faint, explaining why it has thus far gone unnoticed. Its detection would be possible, but would require a systematic search using large telescopes such as the Keck Observatory or Subaru Observatory telescopes on Mauna Kea.

Italian group Belenchia et al propose using opto-mechanical quantum oscillators to measure a specific predicted effect of quantum gravity. Opto-mechanical oscillators are macroscopic objects, like highly reflective silicone mirrors on springs, whose motions can be controlled by pulses of electromagnetic radiation. Belenchia et al explain that the specific effect to look for is a periodic squeezing, or localization of the oscillating component's position; the overall motion will no longer be simple harmonic oscillation, due to corrections from gravitational effects. Another paper by Australian group Gan et al also outlines the feasibility of testing quantum gravity in an opto-mechanical setting. The design of these flavor of experiments is within technical scope, as claimed by the papers, albeit challenging. The opto-mechanical system must be supercooled into a highly quantum mechanical state and extremely precise measurements of the oscillator must be made. More importantly, the underlying concept's validity still needs to be explored through the peer review process. Can opto-mechanical systems of the proposed type interestingly constrain quantum gravity models? This question will resolve positively if the following are satisfied: (a) either the Belanchia or Gan paper receives 10 or more citations on Google Scholar by the end of 2016 (b) an experimental physics paper is published by January 1, 2018 which cites either of the above articles and mentions opto-mechanics to study quantum gravity in the abstract.","['Research Impact', 'Scientific Discoveries', 'Physical Sciences – General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology', 'Physical Sciences – Quantum Mechanics']"

An example of the opposite (rare, finitely occuring) kind is a=3,b=125,c=128, where d=2 x 3 x 5=30. ) The abc conjecture, if true, is regarded as a revelation of deep and surprising connections between the basic arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication, and its truth would have a large number of implications for number theory. In 2012 the mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki posted several long papers on his website in which he claimed to have found a proof of the conjecture. Mochizuki is a highly respected mathematician, but the papers (and previous results) total more than five hundred pages and the mathematics community has yet to understand Mochizuki's work, let alone verify the proof. A conference of experts in December 2015 that took place in Oxford was unable to resolve the matter, but some progress is being made, and a further conference is scheduled for July 2016.

As summarized by The Washington Post, Theranos, once valued at $9 billion based on its immense promise to make blood testing cheaper and more efficient, has been embroiled in questions about its technology and regulatory strategy for months. The scrutiny was sparked by a Wall Street Journal investigation that revealed that the intensely secret company's much-touted fingerprick blood tests were barely being used and employees had raised questions about the accuracy of its tests. In response, Theranos itself claims: Our proprietary devices are making it possible to run finger-stick samples for tests that could never be run on finger-stick before. We began using our proprietary devices in our lab at the launch of our retail operations. And we initiated filings with FDA two years ago—by choice, not necessity—because we are seeking to create a new model for laboratory testing standards, and have championed FDA oversight ever since. It is the right thing, which is also the hard thing. [...] Capabilities of Theranos' devices: The article implies that Theranos' proprietary devices were only capable of running a limited number of tests. First, ""Edison"" is only one of many proprietary devices used as part of Theranos proprietary technologies. In total, Theranos research and development has developed hundreds of tests for finger-stick samples using our proprietary devices. [...] Theranos' filings with FDA show the versatility of Theranos devices, and our confidence in the results of our tests: Theranos has publicly advocated for FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), and over 120 of the tests developed for use on our devices used as part of Theranos proprietary technologies have been submitted in pre-submissions to FDA.

The S&P 500 index is down 10% since the start of 2016, the price of oil has tanked, and the VIX volatility index has jumped by more than 50%, with recent closes consistently above 25. In the popular financial press, the VIX Index is often referred to as the “fear gauge”, and indeed, it's behavior can be modeled as the rate of flow from a reservoir of ""fear"" that is replenished by an autocorrelated process. In reality, it is a quantitative assessment of expected stock market volatility over the next thirty day period, and is computed from S&P 500 stock index option prices. To rule-of-thumb accuracy, the numerical value of the VIX corresponds to the annualized one-sigma percentage change in the value of the S&P 500 Index over the next month. So at present, with the VIX standing at 26, the market ascribes roughly a 30% chance that stocks will have changed in price by more than 7.5%, come March 10th (a month from now).

CDER approves hundreds of new medications each year, most of which are variations of existing products (such as new dosages or generics). A small portion of these approvals are for “novel drugs,” products that are innovative and/or previously unavailable. These are approved either as new molecular entities under New Drug Applications or as new therapeutic biologics under Biologics License Applications. From 2006 to 2014, CDER averaged about 28 novel drug approvals per year. In 2015, CDER hit a 19-year high with 45 approvals. The higher number is due in part to the center’s implementation of four expedited pathways to hasten the approval and release of certain medications judged to be important for the public; 27 of 2015’s 45 novel drugs were approved through this expedited process. A context of rapid progress in a range of medical technologies may also foster a “hyper-innovation age”, yielding many new kinds of therapies and potentially increasing the quantity of innovative drugs approved. As of July 27, CDER lists 16 novel drug approvals for 2016. Will the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research make more than 45 novel drug approvals in 2016?

The concept is simple - people looking to spend the night in a certain city, but who don't want to shell out for a hotel, can rent spare rooms and spare spaces in people's houses. AirBnB provides the platform for renters and owners to connect, and collects a percentage of the transactions as its revenue. Pluses: The company doesn't have to spend a dime on building hotel properties or hiring hospitality staff. It's just a marketplace, where renters and owners do most of the work. Minuses: The company is getting blowback from the governments of both San Francisco and New York City, both of whom are cracking down on non-hotel rentals less than 30 days in duration. Since 2014, rumors have been circulating that AirBnB was preparing for an initial public offering, or IPO, that would make it a publicly-owned company, with stock available on a major stock exchange. As recently as June 2016 the rumors were ramping up again, based on financial rumblings that the company could initiate an IPO to raise cash for expansion. AirBnB turned again to private investors, however, raising around $850 million and valuing the company at $30 billion dollars. After such a large cash infusion, it may be a while before AirBnB need to raise more money from the public. A successful IPO may be all in the timing, however.

Furthermore, the detected event (GW150914) had a number of unusual features: The black holes involved in the merger were heavier than expected to be seen, likely requiring the adjustment of stellar evolution models. The event was observed almost as soon as the machine was turned on. This, combined with the fact that another significant trigger event was also seen in the first few days of data (LVT151012), though not yet confirmed to be genuine, suggests a rate of mergers at the high end of what was considered possible. A gamma ray burst counterpart candidate was unexpectedly observed by Fermi GBM 0.4s after the merger.

So called dark matter ""hairs,"" these would constitute a new prediction of the Big Bang standard model of cosmology, Λ CDM. Dark matter halos are known to collect themselves into cosmic scale filaments, but if the dark matter is sufficiently cold, smaller filaments can also exist on scales comparable to our solar system. Prezéau predicts that if one of these fine-grain streams passes through a planet, gravity squeezes the streams into dense regions (hairs), which exhibit points of critical density (roots) at specified distances away from the center of the planet in question. In the case of Earth, these roots would be located around 10 6 km away from the planetary center, a bit more than twice the distance to the Moon. They would be high-density hot spots for us to look for dark matter particles. If Prezéau's findings are substantially valid, they provide a potential channel of discovery for detecting dark matter.

The NOAA tracks space weather, and has a set of space weather scales for solar radiation storms and geomagnetic storms. The highest ratings, S5 and G5, can disable satellites, affect power grids, and cause other mayhem. This scale would appear to cover too little dynamic range, however, as much stronger storms than S5 and G5 are a matter of historical record (see for example the Carrington Event of 1859), and extrapolating the frequencies provided by the NOAA suggests a high probability of trans-G5 geomagnetic storms in the coming two decades, and a ~1-10\% probabilitiy of a Carrington-like event with an order of magnitude higher energy. Given modern infrastructure, such an event could lead to widespread and long-term blackouts, and cause trillions in damage. In October 2015, the White House published a space weather plan outlining the challenges, and enumerating a number of action items to increase monitoring, understanding, and mitigation of space weather. A key issue is monitoring: early warning of a solar storm can allow significantly mitigation of its effects. While there are already numerous observation sites on Earth and a handful of satellites (SOHO, STEREO, the Van Allen probes, ACE, and most recently DSCOVR) monitoring space weather phenomena, there is a huge volume of measurement left untouched. Most of the aforementioned spacecraft observe solar wind and the Sun's surface, while the Van Allen probes watch for radiation and magnetic storms; DSCOVR is the only satellite to provide early detection of coronal mass ejections. Plans to find a long-term replacement for DSCOVR at the L1 Lagrange point do exist as part of the National Space Weather Program's mission over the next decade. Beyond just finding replacements, the recommendations of policymakers (like this whisper coming out of this year's AAAS meeting) push for more observation spacecraft which can collect forecast data in assessment of risks from space weather. The space weather plan contains the action item (5.3.2) to be completed by October 2016: NASA and DOC will assess space-weather-observation platforms with deep-space orbital positions (including candidate propulsion technology), which allow for additional warning time of incoming space-weather events.

Although Sedol felt he had made some weak moves in game one, Sedol and many commentators felt that he played a very strong second game that was very close until the very end.

828,Will online voting for all registered voters expand by the 2020 general election?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M172,"Although critical to the democratic model of government, voting in America has some problems. Turnout is often low, and the terms ""butterfly ballot"" and ""hanging chad"" still linger in our collective consciousness following the uncertainty of the 2000 presidential election. Since we are already able to do practically everything else via the internet –bank, shop, communicate, etc., – online voting seems like a natural next step. Some argue that online voting would increase turnout and bring voting access to anyone with the internet, without the need to go to a polling place on Election Day. Currently, 22 states allow for some form of online voting, allowing members of the military and other citizens living overseas to return their ballots by email. Only one state - Alaska - allows any registered voter, provided they pre-register, to use an online voting portal. Four other states offer an online voting portal. In March 2016 the Utah Republican Party offered online voting to all registered voters in its presidential caucus. The major problem that hampers every proposal for online voting is security. Repeated analyses find that, given the impossibility of sufficiently protecting the millions of personal devices that would be used in an online election, the risk of malicious interference in the election is too high to recommend proceeding with online voting. The stakes are also too high, the analysts say, with no less than the balance of American political power in play. Still, multiple online voting vendors exist, each claiming to be secure. The fate of online voting may depend on who can make the most innovative advances in internet security: vendors or hackers. Will online voting for all registered voters expand by the 2020 general election? To resolve as positive, a credible news outlet must report that at least five states will allow any registered voter to submit their ballot for the 2020 general election via email or an online voting portal on or before November 3, 2020.","['Technological Advances', 'Computing – Security', 'Elections – U.S.']"

This particular outbreak indicated a direct correlation with the incidence of microencephaly in children born to infected mothers. As of writing, Zika cases have been reported in dozens of countries in North and South America and the Caribbean. A growing focus on the situation has also sparked significant controversy surrounding the methods being employed to combat the disease, specifically the genetic modification of infection vectors such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, to produce sterile offspring. The intent of this effort would be to effectively reduce the A. aegypti population and thus the potential for spreading the virus. Among the numerous (if somewhat unlikely) alternate explanations for the Zika outbreak, there appears to be consensus in scientific community on one point: the absence of direct evidence linking Zika to microencephaly. While some studies have shown that Zika is capable of infecting neural tissue, it is still speculative whether or not it can pass the blood-brain barrier. Due to the recent rise in popularity of the subject, researchers will undoubtedly begin digging deeper into the pathology of Zika virus and its close cousins West Nile and Dengue.

830,Will the number of preprints on the diphoton excess fall within a Poisson distribution with a mean of 271 papers?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M178,"In a recent paper, Backović has studied the phenomenon of ""ambulance chasing"" in particle physics, i.e. the flood of papers in the months following a tentative experimental signal, only to slow as interest is lost, fresh ideas are exhausted or the experimental signatures disproven. Backović shows that a simple two parameter model accurately fits the evolution of the cumulative number of preprints on a topic for nine episodes of ambulance chasing in recent history. The model is then used to forecast the total number of preprints that will be written about the recent 750 GeV diphoton excess seen at the Large Hadron Collider. There is a recent Metaculus question about this topic, asking whether the statistical significance of the excess will increase by the ICHEP conference. The present question is not about the excess itself, but about whether Backović's forecast for the number of preprints on the excess will prove correct. Specifically, Backović predicts that the number of preprints on the arxiv about the diphoton excess by June 1, 2016 follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 271 papers. In other words, the 90% credible interval for the number of preprints is predicted as 244 to 298 (inclusive). This question resolves positively if, on June 1, 2016, the number of preprints on the diphoton excess falls within the range given above. The number of preprints is measured using Backović's methodology, namely, trawling the inSPIRE and arXiv repositories for citations to the original announcement of an excess by ATLAS and selecting only those papers with an arXiv number assigned.","['Research Impact', 'Physical Sciences – High Energy Physics']"

This one will ask if an autonomous vehicle fleet will be in operation for ride sharing, taxi, or shuttling services. Self-driving car (SDC) fleets are seen as perfect for rideshare business models like those of Lyft or Uber, who have effort in moving toward autonomous technology. This focus on rideshare became more apparent when GM invested $500M in autonomous vehicle fleet for Lyft, and the other dominant figures in autonomous vehicle tech like Google, Tesla, and Ford are developing fleets of their own with speculated intent for ridesharing. Like the sister question, technological maturity, regulation, cost, public policy, and safety are the primary obstacles in bringing fully autonomous vehicles to market. By January 1st, 2019, will a fleet of autonomous vehicles be used in a ridesharing or hailing-like service? To resolve positively, there must exist a service in some geographical region available to members of the general public, taking users between two destinations within the region as chosen by the user. There must be at least 50 autonomous vehicles in use in the service, and if the autonomous vehicles are part of a service mixing autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles, rides by autonomous vehicles should make up at least 20% of all rides provided by the overall service within the area served by the autonomous vehicles.","['Computing – Artificial Intelligence', 'Technology – Automotive', 'Technological Advances', 'Technology – Robotics', 'Series – AI milestones']"

Incorporating polarization into enhancing a map of a 3D surface hasn't been engineered before, and the advantage it offers is additional information about the geometry of physical objects based on the way polarized light interacts with their surfaces. For example, specular highlights on objects often lower the rendering capability of computer vision algorithms, but it can be subtracted from objects in computer vision by using polarization filters. The obvious focus for applications of Polarized 3D is in the 3D camera and printing industry. Less obvious is whether this technology can be used on driverless and autonomous cars, most of which require stereoscopic camera arrays as part of their object detection and depth sensing. Self-driving cars do well in fair conditions, but in high precipitation environments, water helps create a variety of optical aberrations that throw off an autonomous car's vision algorithms. In particular, those specular highlights mentioned earlier get amplified on various surfaces in rainy conditions, and subtracting them out would allow for a more accurate depth map. Will an autonomous vehicle project, like the Google Self-Driving Car, integrate light polarization technology into their 3D vision systems by 2019? This question will resolve positively if there is an article published by a top media news outlet, or if a public release is made by an autonomous vehicle developer stating that Polarized 3D (or a closely-related system) is being used to enhance the computer vision systems on a production-model autonomous vehicle.","['Technological Advances', 'Technology – Automotive', 'Technology – Camera']"
834,"by 2020, will the remaining roadblocks be lifted (or circumvented), leading to an implanted human embryo brought fully to term with CRISPR (or a similar system) edited DNA?","['yes', 'no']",yes,M184,"In April of 2015, it was announced that scientists in China had successfully edited the genome of a human embryo using the CRISPR/Cas9 system--a standard synthetic biology tool for gene editing. February 1st of this 2016 marked another major turning point in the field when UK regulators approved gene editing in viable human embryos. This is the first time that any kind of regulatory agency has approved the use of synthetic techniques in humans at the embryonic stage. This may present an open door for other agencies to make similar judgments. It should be noted that the genes targeted in the newly-approved study were chosen by the UK researchers to probe embryonic development, and specifically disapproved for future implantation and maturation. Single-cell embryos are excellent subjects for CRISPR research; their relatively large size enables routine microinjection of the biological macromolecules necessary to perform the edit. A significant drawback, however, is CRISPR efficiency. Like any mutagenic process, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Its targets still have a low chance of being successfully and appropriately edited, thus requiring a sequencing screen to find a match. This has the potential to leave many human embryos unwanted or no longer viable, as in the relatively rare case of an improper edit. On the other hand, there are a number of genetic disorders (cystic fibrosis, for instance) that are rapidly fatal anyway, presenting some cases as prime candidates for CRISPR editing. Now, development of the system in human embryos has precedent, which may lead to other agencies following the example set by the UK. While still strictly illegal in the UK and US, by 2020, will the remaining roadblocks be lifted (or circumvented), leading to an implanted human embryo brought fully to term with CRISPR (or a similar system) edited DNA?

While the automation of repetitive physical labor is an old story, the advent of AI/robotic systems to perform essentially any repetitive physical labor, as well as many non-repetitive physical tasks and also repetitive or non-repetitive cognitive tasks, is likely to dramatically change the dynamics governing human labor and its place in the global economy. In their book, Brynjolfsson & McAfee argue that we are in the early stages of this process, but that it is already underway and has contributed significantly to income inequality and other difficulties in the labor pool. It is thus quite possible that the cause of much of the anger and frustration being channeled by the Trump and Sanders campaigns is fundamentally caused by an automation process that is likely just getting started. However, while a significant topic of conversation in tech and some economic circles, and while politicians love to talk about jobs, the automation of labor has played little to no role in the presidential election thus far. Will this continue to be the case?

836,Will Planet Nine be found in 2016?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M188,"In mid-January, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a worldwide stir by proposing the existence of a new, but as-yet unseen, planet in the outer solar system. This world, now known as ""Planet Nine"", is predicted to have a mass roughly ten times that of Earth, an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a large eccentricity (e~0.6). Batygin and Brown's paper (which, by 3/17, had been downloaded a staggering 307,188 times) presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of small Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. A recent paper by Fienga et al. adds credibility and detail to the Planet Nine hypothesis. The authors examine how Planet Nine affects the orbit of Saturn, whose orbital trajectory can be measured to great accuracy using ranging data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Inclusion of Planet Nine in the ultra-precise INPOP Solar System ephemerides reduces the error in Cassini's position relative to the model if Planet Nine's true anomaly is of order 118 degrees. Based on the Fienga et al. result, Metaculus calculates a most probable current sky position for Planet Nine of RA=2h, Dec=-20 deg, in the constellation Cetus. This area of the sky becomes visible to ground-based wide-field cameras in mid-Summer. At the most probable location, the planet's current distance would be r=620 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 21. An update to our original Planet Nine question is thus definitely in order: Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper, and at a sky position within 20 degrees of the Fienga et al. best-fit location be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to Dec. 31, 2016?

The mosquito species Aedes aegypti has been identified as the primary carrier of Zika and several other pathogens including dengue fever. Oxitec's brand of ""self-limiting"" GMO Aedes aegypti has passed regulatory approval in several countries in central and South America, and has since shown significant efficacy in attenuating the population within targeted regions. Brazil has recently begun expanding Oxitec's vector control program, which they started in 2012. The US state of Florida is now following suit with their own investigative trials into GMO mosquito control. Mosquito transmissions of Zika and dengue do not necessarily pose an imminent threat to the North American region, although there have been several recently-reported cases of transmission due to human-to-human contact. Aedes aegypti is nonetheless an invasive, non-native species. Whether for cost reduction, preemptive disease control, agricultural protection, or other environmental concerns, the US government has selected Oxitec's ""friendly Aedes aegypti"" as a candidate in the Florida Keys.

In May 2013, the median home price in London topped 600,000 GBP, around double the median price in 2009, during the Great Recession. Afraid of a bubble bursting, particularly among the priciest homes, the Bank of Ireland in March stated that it would not give loans greater than 500,000 GBP to protect itself from possible losses in a market correction. To support prices that are well out of range for average Londoners, the British government amended its Help to Buy program, which allows prospective homeowners to borrow up to 20% of the cost of the home from the government before seeking a mortgage for the rest. In London, the government borrowing limit is up to 40% of the home's value, and is capped at 600,000 GBP.

841,"Will a fatality of one or more per year due to accidental infections in ""select agent"" pathogen research labs be reported in the next year?","['yes', 'no']",no,M193,"In the US, medical research on potentially human-harmful viral and bacterial pathogen and other ""select agents"" generally takes place in Biosafety level 3 and level 4 labs. The US select agents program regulates the identification, acquisition, use, transfer, and disposal of select agents. Part of this program is a detailed reporting system of the theft, loss, or accidental release of select agents. A summary of the reports under this system from 2004-2010 by Henkel et al. found eleven laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) during this period (along with 639 accidental ""releases""), but none leading to human fatality. The report showed steadily and quickly increasing (> 29%/year) report numbers from 2004-2010, suggesting increasing reporting rates. (It is also likely that the number of labs working with select agents increased, and in-principle possible that the accident rate increased, but these seem unlikely to explain such a rapid rise.) This leaves open to question how many accidents (and LAIs) go unreported. A 2006 literature review by Harding and Byers found a large number of LAIs, with updated statistics of 2033 LAIs and 37 deaths (with 13 deaths since 2005). These numbers are difficult to compare, as LAIs can occur without an identified accident leading to them. A Google Scholar search of citations to Henkel et al. shows that it has been used to estimate accidental infection rates in a number of papers and reports, but reveals no more-recent followup summary based on the select agent reporting system. Will a new publication based on select-agent reports reveal a per-year fatality rate of unity or greater? To be definite, the question will resolve as positive if, by May 2017, a publication that cites Henkel at al. in a Google Scholar search, and is based on select agent reports, lists at least one LAI fatality that occurred in the most recent year -- or at least two fatalities between the most recent two years -- fully covered by the data used in the publication.

As of March 20, 2016, according to CDC numbers, the outbreak caused 28608 cases and 11305 fatalities. The outbreak is now largely contained thanks to a belated but significant international effort, including ~$5.3B in funding allocated by the US. As of writing, there is a standoff in congress between the Obama Administration and Congress over where funding to address the current Zika outbreak should come from. The administration has requested approx. $1.9B US; congress has so far left this request unfunded, requiring instead that the Administration spend money remaining from the emergency Ebola funding instead of appropriating additional money to address Zika. Approx. $2.5B in Ebola funding remains unspent (out of $5.3B allocated during the epidemic). However, the current plan for that funding is to spend it on preparedness infrastructure in developing countries so that they can better prevent, detect, or respond to outbreaks in the future. Future outbreaks of Ebola -- among other diseases -- are inevitable (the CDC site lists 13 Ebola outbreaks since 2000); the question is how large they will become, which depends largely on the infrastructure in-place and the ability for local and global fast response to the outbreak. Will the next outbreak of Ebola be better contained than the last?

844,"By 2020, will a US clinical trial begin in which the goal is a temporary or permanent complete inhibition of the pain response in a human?","['yes', 'no']",no,M196,"The scientific community has--for over a decade--recognized that the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 protein, which is found in neurons among nearly every type of human tissue, is primarily responsible for pain sensing in mammals. Small-molecule inhibitors of this channel, however, fail to completely shut off the pain response in humans. Mysteriously, a non-functional mutant of this protein homologue in mice has been shown to achieve painlessness. Since then, a number of drugs with marginal success have been developed by multinational healthcare companies, including Roche and Biogen. A recent study has revealed a novel function of Nav1.7 that may present a possible new target for drug therapies against chronic pain. According to scientists from the lab of Dr. John Wood at University College London, deletion or deleterious mutation of the Nav1.7 gene in mice caused the expression of opiate-simulating proteins (""opioids"") to be up-regulated--a contribution to their painlessness not observed in humans. A Nav1.7-lacking, pain-insensitive human subject, after being given opioid blockers, was able to feel pain for the first time. A combined treatment with opioids in addition to Nav1.7 blockers in mice proved to have the expected opposite effect: a complete suppression of the pain response. The newly-discovered treatment apparently works, but still remains somewhat impractical. While relatively small, biologics like opiods are fairly difficult (and therefore expensive) to produce, store, distribute, etc. Other options would be geneitc modification or, more commonly, a small-molecule substitute--specifically, one that will inhibit the opiod-regulating function of Nav1.7, either directly or indirectly. Regardless of treatment options, the discovery has the potential to significantly change the way we approach pain management. By 2020, will a US clinical trial begin in which the goal is a temporary or permanent complete inhibition of the pain response in a human? For a positive resolution, there must exist by Jan 1, 2020 a clinical trial in the US database with a start date prior to Jan 1, 2020, which aims to use the Nav1.7 channel to completely suppress the human pain response in part or all of the body.","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Scientific Discoveries', 'Biological Sciences – Neuroscience', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine']"

Its presence is manifested gravitationally, however, as it is required to explain the dynamics of galaxies, clusters, and cosmic large-scale structures, affects the microwave background anisotropies, and can even be mapped using gravitational lensing. Several candidate particles responsible for dark matter have been proposed, but the current front-runners are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). This attractiveness stems largely from the fact that SUSY naturally predicts the existence of a supersymmetric WIMP with kinematic and cosmological constraints consistent with dark matter. Since WIMPs interact with ordinary matter via the electroweak interaction, they can in principle be detected directly in [scattering events with atomic nuclei], among other methods. However, experiments to detect them have only given null results so far. A major ongoing test for WIMP-nucleon scattering is Xenon1T in Italy, with a much higher sensitivity than preceding experiments; this dark matter detector is essentially a 3500 kilogram target of liquid Xenon sandwiched between two arrays of photomultiplier tubes. The arrays will detect signals from scintillation and electron drift generated from particles scattering off Xenon nuclei, at which point known backgrounds will be subtracted out to get the WIMP signal. Xenon1T is expected to start collecting data in spring 2016. Failure to see supersymmetry at the LHC so far, with no sign of WIMPs in direct-detection so far has raised the question as to whether WIMPs deserve their dark matter frontrunner status. But perhaps they will be vindicated soon?

The sum total of electricity generation from solar and wind sat at 5.7% in July 2015, but the fraction of added capacity from renewables in 2015 was 69%, according to this Cleantechnica report. To get the percentage of total U.S. electricicty production by solar and wind to the tens of percent necessary to significantly impact carbon emissions it doesn't just mean that more panels and turbines need to be built; wind and solar will have to proportionally overcome energy production from coal, nuclear power, hydroelectric, and natural gas, to dominate the new added capacity for years to come. The sudden momentum boost for newly-added wind and solar energy recently is most likely because they're the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions. Will this trend in renewable energy continue, such that 80% of the added U.S. electricity generation capacity in 2016 comes from solar and wind power?

In an amusing twist, Facebook's ""M"" personal assistant led to an actual investigative report as to whether it was actually an AI or humans masquerading as AI. In this series of questions we probe some fun, interesting, and disquieting possibilities that may come to pass over the next few years through the blurring of these lines. We start with video. The ability of generate highly believable CGI has existed for some time, but has generally fallen short of of creating believable humans, with a dangerous ""uncanny valley"" discouraging many attempts. That is changing, however. In the movie Terminator 5, a relatively convincing circa-1980's Arnold Schwarzenegger was digitally generated atop a live actor to create scenes in which ""young Arnold"" fought ""old Arnold.""

Late last year, a new system was announced that can superimposed both words and facial movements upon a person who never said those words, simulating for example Obama giving Bush's speech or vice-versa. While photographs have long been realized to be suspect due to photoshopping, the era of spoofed videos is just beginning and probably not widely known.

It portrays a well-known person doing and/or saying something they did not in reality say or do. The video has had more than 1 million views.

Among its many projects, Facebook's ""M"" personal assistant service is in active testing and development. According to a piece written by an early adopter, it is rather unclear to what extent this service is an AI and to what extent it is human, and at least some queries appear to be human-fulfilled. This may be a temporary phase in which the system learns how humans fulfill a variety of requests, or may harbinger a future model of hybrid human-AI system.

In recent news, a computer system (using lots of human input) has been developed to create realistic Rembrandt paintings. In April 2016, a program (again with lots of human support) assembled a novel that passed the first round in a Japanese literary competition. And computer-generated music has been with us for a while, with systems capable of generating novel pieces in the style of existing composers. As these systems improve, we are likely to see more attempts, like the Japanese novel, to enter AI systems into human competitions -- it's great press. Will one succeed by mid-2017? This resolves as positive if a computer system enters a competition and wins a prize of monetary value >$500 USD in art, literature or music. The computer system must be capable -- after training -- of generating the entire piece on its own as well as generating qualitatively different pieces. (That is, a human-computer hybrid system does not count, as there are many of these already.) If the computer system wins, but is then not awarded a prize due to rules/outrage, that still fulfills the criteria. The competition should be one targeted explicitly or implicitly at humans rather than programs. To mix things up, this will also resolve positive if (as in our startup fraud question) a sneaky human masquerading as an AI enters and wins a competition in art, literature or music created for computer systems. In either case, we anticipate sufficient media coverage to bring the event to light, but some potential but hard-to-avoid ambiguity in a clean resolution.","['Technological Advances', 'Computer Science – AI and Machine Learning', 'Series – AI ambiguity', 'Computing – Artificial Intelligence']"

With the nearest stars parsecs away, reaching them in a human lifetime requires speeds of at least 10% the speed of light. As can be seen from the rocket equation, chemical rockets with exhaust speeds of a few km/s would require exponentially large mass to attain relativistic speeds of ~100,000 km/s. It's hopeless. Unless relativistic exhaust speeds can be obtained (difficult!), leaving the solar system will require external acceleration. A variety of schemes along these lines have been proposed over the years. For example, the ""starwisp"" is a small nanowire mesh ""sail"" driven by the radiation pressure of reflected microwaves; the microwaves would be produced by a phased array of terrestrial or orbital dishes. Recently, a detailed study of laser-driven sails was posted proposing use of newly-developed ultra-high-reflectivity materials, and (now technically feasible) phased arrays of optical/IR lasers. High reflectivity allows acceleration without incineration; phased arrays allow a highly collimated beam without a laser of enormous diameter. While technically plausible, such systems would require large-scale investment in both R&D and deployment on the scale of at least a major NASA mission or large-scale particle physics project. The possibility of this occurring just received a major boost with the announcement that entrepreneur and Philanthropist Yuri Milner has committed $100 Million to a ""research and engineering program [that] will seek proof of concept for using light beam to propel gram-scale ‘nanocraft’ to 20% light speed.""

MDMA has a storied history beginning from its synthesis in 1912, to its use in psychotherapy in the '60s and its advent into recreational use in popular culture. While being a Schedule I substance in the U.S., and in general a legally controlled substance around the world, it's argued the classification is based on outdated science and that the drug is over-criminalized. MDMA chiefly acts as a releasing agent for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; here's how it works. It's taken recreationally to induce euphoria, sociability, relaxation, heightened sensation and sexuality, but also brings on short-term effects like dehydration and nausea, and potential long-term effects like paranoia and addiction. However, evidence for the true extent of harm from MDMA isn't rock-solid and it appears that side-effects can be mitigated through moderate usage and dosing. There is a body of evidence for the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychiatric treatment, and many advocate that more research to evaluate MDMA's usefulness in this regard. Non-profit MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, is the only organization with funding in MDMA clinical trials to assist in the treatment of PTSD and social anxiety in autistic adults. MAPS is pushing for FDA approval of a medically available MDMA, and they are poised to enter phase 3 clinical trials in 2017.

Their findings, if successful, are expected for submission to the FDA for approval in 2021. However, the organization says it needs about $20 million to complete the trials.

The prospect of building interstellar probes places a suddenly renewed emphasis on discovering the planetary companions to the closest stars. Exhibits A, B, and C in this effort are the members of the Alpha-Proxima Centauri triple system. The Alpha Centauri A-B binary, which lies a mere 4.37 light years distant, harbors two sun-like stars of 1.1 and 0.9 solar masses on a moderately eccentric (e=0.52) 79-year orbit.

SETI's Allen Telescope Array (ATA), in the mountains of Northern California, is an array of 42 antennas that, together, can achieve the astronomical observing power of much larger antenna dishes. Since its completion in 2007, the ATA has been listening to the skies for clear, repeating radio signals at frequencies that might indicate broadcasts by an intelligent civilization. From 2009-2015, the ATA focused on known extrasolar planets, but found no signals that met the criteria for alien life. Red dwarf stars had previously been dismissed as SETI targets because their chances for hosting habitable planets were thought to be dim. But red dwarves are abundant in the galaxy, and some are closer to the earth than more sun-like stars, meaning that signals from close red dwarves (such as Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Sun) would be stronger and clearer. As many as one-half of red dwarves may hold planets in the so-called ""habitable zone."" Research into such possible planets (which would likely be locked with one side facing the star at all times and the other side in eternal night) suggest that oceans and atmospheres could move enough heat around to allow life to develop and thrive. Another plus: red dwarves are old stars, allowing life more time to develop intelligence and technology. By focusing on a certain star type, astronomers will gather a large dataset on red dwarves, possibly uncovering new insights about the star type that will be useful to astronomers, even if a signal of alien life is not found. Will the Allen Telescope Array's survey of red dwarf stars yield valuable scientific information, whether regarding ET life or just the physics of red dwarf stars (or even some other radio sources serendipidously observed)?

While described as ""patent trolls"" by some, such companies argue that they are fostering the generation of intellectual property and then protecting the owners (including themselves) of that IP. An interesting effort was recently launched to -- it would seem -- throw a wrench in various gears grinding in the patent (and patent litigation) industries. All Prior Art generates and publishes online an immense number of ""known inventions"" that are algorithmically generated using the text from the US patent database. (A sister entity All Prior Claims does something similar.) The stated claim is: The intent is not to prevent actual creative and innovative patents from being filed, it is to take the obvious and easily automated ideas out-of-play. If an idea is truly creative and innovative, a computer should have difficulty coming up with it. It is unclear whether this database has actually been used in patent evaluation at this time. Although most of the published inventions are (readable) nonsense, it is quite possible that some of them describe (perhaps with some interpretation) actual workable inventions, and that with better algorithms some of those inventions might even become interesting or make up a higher proportion of the total. As the site says: It is not unforeseeable with current technology (along with sufficient cash for fees) to flood the actual patent application process itself with sufficiently advanced patent applications based on this concept. It is also easy to imagine (though possibly challenging to implement) a system that ensures novelty by comparing against both the US patent database and the Prior Art database. One can also envisage a ""competitor"" system that generates patents more effectively than Prior Art, runs them against the Prior Art database to ensure that they are novel, and files them for patenting.

The US region most likely to be highly impacted by Zika first is Puerto Rico. Therefore we ask: Will mosquitos engineered to reduce the Aedes aegypti population be released in Puerto Rico by January 2017?

Current numbers are hard to come by, but as of Jan 22, this compendium showed an estimated 1.5M cases worldwide, dominated by Brazil but with thousands of cases each in Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, and Honduras. This question concerns how quickly Zika will spread and grow during the next 1.5 years, and focuses on the US where reporting and projections by the CDC can be assumed to be relatively accurate. A key question regards Puerto Rico, which currently has active Zika transmission along with a severe financial crisis. As of mid-April 2016, The CDC projects that 25% of Puerto Rico's 3.5M population could be come infected, with up to 80% eventually infected. High traffic between Puerto Rico (as well as Mexico) and the US suggests US mosquito-borne infection is just a matter of time.

Anomolous surface warming has risen steadily to roughly 0.8°C from the global mean surface air temperature between 1951 and 1980 (the mean being 14°C / 57°F - why this period?), and there are a number of climate models that project increases up to a full degree of anomolous surface warming in the next decade. This is an unprecedented amount of warming in the scope of historical climate models of the Earth. Among the steps taken towards counteracting climate change and the rise in surface temperature anomaly, the Paris Climate Agreement in the winter of 2015 laid down the following mission: (a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This question targets humans' ability to curb climate change. Among the models mentioned earlier, there are some best-case scenarios which suppose significant involvement among the Paris Agreement nations to shift the weight of energy generation from fossil fuels to clean energy methods. Will the anomalous global surface temperature in 2020 be less than 1.0 °C above the 1951-1980 mean?

Fundamental laws of physics such as Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity can be consistently posed in any number of spatial dimensions (though more than one time dimension is generally problematic), and mathematically N dimensions are just about as easy to described as 3. Relatively few compelling explanations have been put forth to explain this question. One explanation is the ""anthropic"" one: too few dimensions life is very difficult (e.g. a 2D lifeform can't have a digestive tract without bifurcating!), and in 4+ dimensions orbits and traditional atoms are unstable. (See Max Tegmark's paper for some details.)

It's mission is to provide high energy gain from the fusion of a hydrogen fuel pellet, ignited using an impressive array of 192 lasers (see how it works). Development of the NIF has had a rocky history. Construction finished in 2009, and a campaign was launched that year to bring the laser system up to ignition specifications, which ended in 2012 at only a small fraction of its design goal. When the ignition campaign fell short, the success of the program to produce a positive yield in fusion energy was questioned, and not for the first time. Proposals have been made to entirely shift the NIF from a fusion energy facility to a research facility of different stripes, including weapons and materials research. Currently, the fusion experiments at NIF are focused on optimizing different aspects of their ICF ignition process. In particular, increasing shot rate has been a key metric over the past years, with 356 shots fired in 2015 at experimental targets and more ongoing in 2016.

875,"Will NASA rejoin as a larger partner in the eLISA mission, meeting or exceeding 20% contribution in funding?","['yes', 'no']",no,M234,"eLISA (Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is one of the leading projects in the newly born field of gravitational wave astronomy. Two key landmark successes came together in 2016 that have sparked great enthusiasm for the potential of the eLISA proposal; first, LIGO published in February the first detection of Einstein-gravity waves, and secondly, the LISA pathfinder probe, designed to test the technical challenges of the eLISA mission, found eLISA to be feasible. The advisory panel even encouraged the possibility of an earlier launch date, which would move the launch from the mid 2030s to 2029. The following is a synopsis of the mission design - for more depth, see the whitepaper. Three satellites forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle (side length 1 million km!) will be launched into a heliocentric orbit, trailing the Earth by 20°. Like LIGO, eLISA is based on a Michelson interferometer design; two spacecrafts make up the endpoints of the interferometer arms and send and receive laser light to a source craft, which then measures the changing arm length through phase differences in the light. However, the core variable eLISA is measuring is the changing non-geodesic acceleration between a pair of test masses housed in free-fall in the source spacecraft. Combined with interferometric measurements on additional test masses housed in each arm, a signal and noise spectrum can be established on the contracting and expanding spacetime between the masses due to gravitational waves. eLISA can measure the frequency, phase, and polarity information of the incoming waves to identify high-magnitude gravitational events, such as inspiraling black hole binaries. Formerly LISA, eLISA was intended to be a joint endeavor between NASA and ESA. In 2011, a lack of funding led to NASA removing itself from the efforts of the mission. The mission development is currently led by ESA with limited participation by NASA, but resource constraints on ESA's part may create a compelling need for more U.S. - European collaboration. Currently ESA permits a maximum of 20% contribution from NASA; will this change? Will NASA rejoin as a larger partner in the eLISA mission, meeting or exceeding 20% contribution in funding? Resolution is positive if by mid-September 2017, credible media report indicates that NASA has re-entered the eLISA collaboration as a significant partner, committing at least 20% of the project budget.","['Scientific Discoveries', 'Physical Sciences – Astrophysics and Cosmology', 'Physical Sciences – General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']"

There is, however, no good reason to believe this is the case. While medical countermeasures and sanitation are dramatically improved, global interconnectivity and human (and livestock) population density are much higher, creating favorable conditions for the emergence of natural pandemics. Moreover, while national militaries have for some time had the capability of weaponizing pathogens, the advent of effective genetic engineering suggests that this capability — as well as the ability to generate qualitatively new pathogens — may become much more widely available to both nations and terror groups, increasing the risk of bioterror or bioerror incidents. Perhaps the highest risk for a natural pandemic is posed by new versions of influenza. Per a 2008 paper: Since 1500, there appear to have been 13 or more influenza pandemics[....]; in the past 120 years there were undoubted pandemics in 1889, 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977. In 1918, the worst pandemic in recorded history caused approximately 546,000 excess deaths in the United States (675,000 total deaths) and killed up to 50 million people worldwide.

Both transmissibility and fatality rates vary significant across such diseases. The cold is generally highly transmissible but very rarely fatal. The relatively new MERS coronavirus is fatal in of order 40% of cases, though its transmissibility is currently low. Most worrisome are pathogens combining high transmissibility with a relatively high fatality rate: the Spanish Flu, with a 5-10% fatality rate and very easy airborne transmission, was a tragic example.

Mosquito-borne viral illnesses include Yellow Fever, Dengue Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile virus, and a host of others. Many mosquito-borne illnesses are have been known since ancient times, but some new ones are regularly discovered. The Zika virus, first isolated in the 1950s in humans, has recently become a major health threat, and is the subject of several other questions. While Zika has an even lower mortality rate than malaria (its larger threat being to the as-yet-unborn), other recently-emerged pathogens could be worse. For example, Eastern Equine Encephalitis discovered in the 1930's, has a much higher fatality rate of ~30% (fortunately its prime carrier mosquito feeds almost exclusively on birds.)

General Fusion, based in British Columbia, is a privately funded company pursuing magnetized target fusion (MTF), backed by venture capital funds as well as individual backers including Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Peter Thiel (PayPal). MTF works by heating a gaseous fusion fuel into a plasma, coercing it into magnetic confinement, and then uniformly compressing the plasma until it reaches fusion-capable densities and temperatures. In General Fusion's case, an array of pneumatic impact pistons in a ""Spheromak"" design serve as acoustic drivers for the compression stage, delivering a high impulse but requires extreme timing precision. General Fusion is currently in the midst of the testing and development phase of the individual subsystems for their prototype MTF reactor, and the next goal is to build a full scale device to achieve net-gain fusion. However, they currently face a great challenge in keeping the plasma thermally well insulated in order to meet design temperatures before compression. General Fusion's reactor design specifies plasma temperatures of T = 10 KeV/ k b (over 100 million Kelvin) after 10:1 radial compression. A milestone before this is the 4:1 compression stage in subsystem testing, at which they have been able to heat the plasma to 200 eV/ k b but hope to exceed temperatures of 600 eV/ k b.

We've rather luckily avoided bioterror attacks in the past, which have primarily been attempted using anthrax, a deadly but non-communicable pathogen. Attacks in the US in 2001 were successful but small-scale. (It has been asserted but not proved by the US government that these were carried out by a microbiologist and biodefense researcher.) A large-scale attempt in Tokyo by the Aum Shinrikyo cult in 1993 might have been disastrous, but it appears that the cult accidentally used an attenuated vaccinating strain and inadvertently but fortunately immunized rather than killed a large number of Tokyo's citizens with anthrax. A terror group combining the resources of the Aum Shinrikyo cult with professional-level expertise and viable samples of bioterror agents could lead to truly terrifying results. A number of pathogens and biologically-created toxins have been evaluated for use as bioweapons (see this publications for a list and some background.) Some of these agents, as well as some others, have been more highly weaponized in previous bio-warfare programs of which the Soviet Union's was a prime example.

The scale and effect of such attacks could easily increase in the future. As for human pathogens, agricultural or livestock-oriented pathogens might be improved by selective ""breeding"" or by genetic engineering (and without quite as much danger to the human scientists!) Moreover, many of todays crops and livestock are monocultures or clones with very little genetic diversity, raising the concern that a single pathogen could spread unchecked and potentially destroy an entire industry. (See for example the past and future of the banana.) Finally, modern factory farming and high-intensity agriculture make an ideal environment for a quickly spreading pathogen.

888,"By 2020 will a human be deliberately infected (without their consent) by a pathogenic virus genetically engineered to increase its virulence, transmissibility, or scope of effect?","['yes', 'no']",no,M253,"Given the dramatic advances in our ability to understand and modify the genome of organisms, the idea of a pathogen that has been genetically engineered (rather than artificially selected) to increase its virulence, transmissibility, or scope of effect is a rapidly growing concern. As discussed in this question, researchers have successfully ""upgraded"" H5N1 to be airborne, using techniques that could also be applied to MERS and SARs — all pathogens with high virulence but low transmissibility. One could also imagine increasing the virulence of highly-transmissible flus or other illnesses. Techniques used by these groups have been published and are thus available to other researchers with sufficient expertise. Bioweapons research on large scales is outlawed by the Bioweapons Convention, but this did not prevent the Soviets from following a massive program into the 1980s and perhaps 1990s, and it is quite possible that clandestine programs exist today using more modern techniques. Genetic engineering also opens up possibilities that do not exist in nature or earlier research efforts. For example, pathogens could be engineered to attack people with genetic markers strongly correlated with particular races or types of ancestry (as so-called ""ethnic bioweapon""). An agent might even target an individual person's genome. As these techniques grow more powerful and accessible, we ask how likely is such an attack, which would combine ability to genetically engineer pathogens with intent to cause harm (or at least act without consent): By 2020 will a human be deliberately infected (without their consent) by a pathogenic virus genetically engineered to increase its virulence, transmissibility, or scope of effect? The question resolves as positive whether or not the attack is successful, but should be termed an attack: deliberate and unfriendly. Resolution is by report from a credible media, government or other source.","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Biology – Infectious Disease', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine', 'Biological Sciences – Bioengineering', 'Series – Pandemics']"
889,By the end of 2018 will US federal funding go to 2 or more research projects performing GOF research of concern?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M256,"In an effort to better understand the pathways by which H5N1 (and other flue), MERS, SARS, etc., may become more dangerous, several research groups have begun to deliberately engineer viruses to increase their virulence, transmissibility, or other qualities. This ""gain of function"" (GoF) research may help prepare use for naturally-occuring variants of these diseases and enhance our ability to generate better vaccines, etc. However, there are obvious potential dangers as well: an accidental release, or deliberate theft of such organisms could create a potential pandemic; even the information published about such efforts could increase the probability of bioterror or bioerror events. In October 2014, the White House issued a funding pause on such experiments involving influenza and coronaviruses, partly in response to a statement by the Cambridge Working Group that called for a curtailment of experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens in the laboratory, pending a risk and benefit assessment. The White House charged the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity (NSABB) with commissioning such a report. After the completion of this report and several high-level meetings, the NSABB composed a set of recommendations; see the draft report here. These recommendations do not call for a moratorium on the funding of any particular types of research, but for various levels of additional oversight in the funding of ""gain of function research of concern,"" (GoFRoC) which they define as a subset of GoF research that is highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations; and highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans. The report calls for ""additional, multidisciplinary review, prior to determining whether they are acceptable for funding. If funded, such projects should be subject to ongoing oversight at the Federal and institutional levels"" and calls for ""An external advisory body that is designed for transparency and public engagement should be utilized as part of the U.S. government’s ongoing evaluation of oversight policies for GOF research of concern."" Many elements of this whole issue (and see here for a good summary) could form the basis of questions. Here we focus on the bottom line: By the end of 2018 will US federal funding go to 2 or more research projects performing GOF research of concern? Resolution is positive if two of more distinct federal grants have been fully approved that fund GoFRoC research, i.e. have been identified in review as this type of research, received (we can hope) additional levels of scrutiny, and received approval. This may be identified by media report, by presence in an accessible research grant database, or other credible source.","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Biology – Infectious Disease', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine', 'Biological Sciences – Bioengineering', 'Series – Pandemics']"

(Bioweapons programs, if they exist despite international treaty, are secret and/or classified.) Nonetheless, some research and research publication have encountered criticism for potentially increasing the risk of accidental pandemic, or deliberate bioweapon attack. In a prominent example, in 2012 a Dutch research group published a description of a lab-modified strain of H5N1 influenza virus capable of airborne transmission between ferrets. This came after intense controversy including a recommendation-then-reversal by the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) that the research not be published. See here for summary and an update on the story. Gain-of-function research of the type described in these publications has been under a funding moratorium in the US since 2014; however as detailed in a separate question, the research may be ""allowed"" in some cases in the US, and can continue elsewhere or using alternative funding. This raises questions about the publication of such information, and the responsibility of journals (if any) in deciding whether it should be published. We ask: By 2018 will an event occur in which a credible media source reports that a major medical journal has declined to publish an otherwise-publishable scientific paper on human pathogens due to concerns that it constitutes an information hazard? We will consider any journal in this top 100 list to be a major medical journal. The question resolves as positive even if the paper is published after resubmission to a second (or third...) journal, as long as it is rejected for information-hazard rather than research quality reasons. The rejection may be at the journal's discretion or by request (or requirement) from an external party.","['Biological Sciences – Bioengineering', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine', 'Biology – Infectious Disease', 'Series – Pandemics']"

893,Is market volatility set to strongly increase?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M262,"The UK's decision to leave the European Union caught Metaculus modestly by surprise. Consensus on ""leave"" was that there was a 32% chance. The Brexit, however, really caught the global financial markets by surprise. In the days prior to the vote, stock prices across the world were generally on the increase, with the S&P 500 peaking at 2112.93 at the close of the US Market on June 23rd, not far from its all-time high. And as measured by closing options prices on the index, demand for insurance against loss while the vote was well under way was not particularly high. A few hours later, however, as it became clear that ""Leave"" would prevail, futures contracts on the S&P 500 went into free fall. At one point, in the midst of heavy overnight trading at the CME, they plunged nearly 6%. Market losses the next day were very heavy across the board. More than 2 trillion dollars in global stock market value evaporated. Viewed another way, each of the 17,410,742 ""leave"" votes generated a $115,000 loss in global market capitalization, a value that is nearly three times larger than the British per-capita GDP. As usual, the market losses were accompanied by steep increases in volatility. The VIX index spiked to a high of 26.24, closing up 49.33% in a single trading session. Impressive as that jump may sound, the forthcoming market disruptions implied by VIX are actually relatively modest. During the throes of the Financial Crisis in October 2008, a peak VIX print of 89.53 was observed. Roughly speaking, the value of the VIX index amounts to the expected one-sigma change in the S&P 500 index price during the coming year. A look at the time series for the VIX shows that volatility tends to spike abruptly, and then decay in a roughly exponential manner over a period of months until the next shock hits. The VIX process is clearly not a random walk. Indeed, it certainly looks amenable to prediction... Before getting online with your broker, however, it pays to recall the worn adage that ""a fool and his money are soon parted"".

894,Will the California Drought end in 2017?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M263,"The 2015-2016 rainfall season brought some relief to California, following several years of well-below-average rain and snowfall. The northern half of the state received more-or-less average rain and snowfall, but the much-vaunted El Niño Southern Oscillation did not live up to expectations for the southern half of the state. The El Niño conditions ended in May, and a band of cool ocean water is now developing in the central and east-central Pacific. This phenomenon is associated with the La Niña flipside of the Southern Oscillation. Empirically, La Niña tends to be associated with dry winters for California, but the connection is by no means one to one. It therefore falls on Metaculus to determine whether the drought will be busted in 2016-2017. The severity of regional drought conditions is tracked and updated weekly by the National Drought Monitor. As of June 11, 2016, 42.8% of California's area is classified as experiencing ""extreme"" (code D3) or ""exceptional"" (code D4) drought.

It is generally agreed that no evidence of such civilizations exists. Indeed, the apparent lack of aliens, in conjunction with the known profusion of stars and planets, forms the basis for the so-called Fermi Paradox. The announcement in the news media of the detection of an alien-generated signal, or some other strong evidence of an extraterrestrial civilization, would clearly generate quite a bit of interest. This would be especially true if the announcement was authorized by a reputable and authoritative source or coalition of sources. Examples might include NASA, NSF, ESO, IAU, AAS, etc. Depending on the content of the message, or on the nature of the evidence, societal implications could potentially be profound. By December 31, 2019, will the New York Times publish an article suggesting that reasonable scientific evidence for an extraterrestrial civilization has been found? Note that this question is not asking whether extraterrestrial contact will actually take place. Despite strong efforts at both peer review and confirmation, official press releases on scientific topics of public interest are sometimes more definitive in tone than is warranted by later consensus. The 1996 New York Times article describing evidence for fossil life in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001 is a good example.

This is, however, not quite the end of the story. The referendum was, technically, non-binding, and many things must happen in order to actually enact withdrawal from the EU. Most centrally, perhaps, is that per Article 50 of the EU treaty, the nation wishing to exit provides a notification to the EU, negotiates the withdrawal terms and sets a date of of when the treaty terms no longer apply. See this description in Wikipedia. In this question we give Metaculus predictors a chance to win back some of their hard (for the most part) lost points on brexit by asking if the UK will actually exit in the next several years.

With this discovery, HD 219134 c ranks as the closest known transiting exoplanet. This announcement seems unlikely to be met with much fanfare in the news media. NASA's Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of transiting planets, several of which are argued to be potentially habitable, and HD 219134 c, with its orbital period of 6.8 days, is anything but. It evokes nostalgia for the turn of the century, when the discovery of even a thoroughly uninhabitable transiting planet was headline news. Transits are scientifically valuable because they enable direct measurements of planetary densities, and they impart clues about bulk and atmospheric compositions. Probing of exoplanetary atmospheres, however, requires bright parent stars. HD 219134, with its mere 6.55 parsec (21.4 light year) distance, is important in this regard because it appears ~10,000 times brighter than many of the host stars of the planets found by the Kepler Mission.

The incident sparked a debate about the use of force in police encounters, as well as the lack of comprehensive reporting of such incidents. Currently, the Bureau of Justice Statistics compiles reports from state agencies of deaths that occurred while in police custody. By the bureau's own admission, however, more than half of such deaths may go unreported. To cover the gap, several independent organizations have launched their own tracking systems, notably Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. Building on their work, journalists at the Washington Post and The Guardian have followed up on reports of police-related deaths, which are gathered from social media and news reports, to compile databases and tell the stories behind each incident. The Washington Post's database is unique because it tracks only shooting deaths and not other deaths in police custody, such as the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Md., which was attributed to injuries sustained while detained in a police van. By the Post's accounting, 990 people were fatally shot in police encounters in the United States in 2015. Further statistics paint a picture of the majority of encounters: Most of the victims were white males, armed with a deadly weapon in the process of an active attack. By race, 26% of those shot and killed were black and 17% were Hispanic. Mental illness played a factor in at least 25% of incidents. In December 2015, the FBI announced that their system for tracking deaths in police custody, including non-shooting incidents, would dramatically expand by 2017. Many solutions have been proposed to reduce police shootings, including additional training on interacting with mentally ill individuals. The effectiveness of such efforts, however, is most directly measured in the total number of shooting deaths by years' end. As of early July 2016, the Post reported 505 police shooting deaths in 2016, 27 more cumulative deaths than at the same time last year.

Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, dramatically extrapolated, suggest paths by which we might be denizens of a simulated world. In what we might call ""natural consciousness, virtual reality"" (NCVR), a (presumably) biologically based consciousness would be fooled, via its sensory inputs, into believing it exists in a very different reality than its physical body. This is the conceit behind, for example, The Matrix movie series and the ""brain in a vat"" set of philosophical explorations. A different mode, ""artificial consciousness, simulated reality"" (ACSR) considers artificially intelligent and conscious computer programs that experience a fully fabricated reality – what might be true (under certain philosophical assumptions) if a non-playing character in a video game were sufficiently complex as to have an internal subjective experience. (This would also describe the ""Agents"" in The Matrix.) While this is (literally!) the stuff of science fiction, there are cogent arguments put forth in the literature, for example by Bostrom, that we are likely to be in a simulated reality. In a nutshell, if such simulations are possible, it is likely that somewhere in spacetime they will be performed, and arguably give rise to many, many more simulated beings than does the ""real world."" Thus if we assume just that we are subjectively self-aware beings, we are more likely to be one of the simulated ones than a ""real"" one. This argument has recently been in the news when Elon Musk asserted that “There’s a one in billions chance [we’re in] base reality... I think it’s one in billions."" While primarily a topic of late-night conversations after a few drinks, it does not seem impossible for this to be the subject of some rigorous research, and careful investigation might well lead to interesting insights into, for example, theories of consciousness, artificial intelligence, the interpretations of quantum mechanics, the anthropic principle, etc. On the other hand, investigating a problem at the intersection of four inscrutable and intractable problems may just be the road to madness.

905,Will a decision be issued in the CRISPR/Cas9 patent interference case by the end of 2017 that overturns Zhang's 2014 patent?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M284,"In 2012, CRISPR/Cas9 burst onto the genetic scene with the limitless promise of gene editing, the ability to remove or replace genetic material in living cells. The landmark discovery has since become tangled in a bitter patent dispute, however, that could shape how the technology can be developed going forward. CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."" First discovered in bacteria in 1987, CRISPR refers to a system used by cells to recognize and excise foreign DNA, such as from viruses. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology introduces a strand of RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme to specific locations in the genome and precisely cuts DNA, like a pair of scissors. The target gene is either replaced with a new genetic sequence or is deleted entirely, and the change to the genetic sequence of that cell is permanent. CRISPR/Cas9 has already been used in many organisms and, once fully developed, could point the way toward repairing faulty genes in human genetic disorders. First, however, CRISPR/Cas9 must endure a patent fight to decide which of the several scientists involved in the technology's discovery can claim the sole right to license CRISPR/Cas9 to laboratories and reap the profits of such exclusivity. The key players: Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley. Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published the first CRISPR/Cas9 paper in 2012, describing use of the technique in a bacterial cell - a prokaryotic cell without a nucleus. Doudna's patent application for the technique, filed first, is still pending. Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Independent of Doudna and Charpentier, Zhang published a paper in early 2013 that first showed use of CRISPR/Cas9 in a eukaryotic cell, or a cell with a nucleus. Zhang had his patent application expedited, however, and although he filed later than Doudna, his patent was awarded in 2014. Doudna's challenge to Zhang's patent triggered the current dispute, called an ""interference."" A complicating wrinkle in the dispute is a law that took effect on March 16, 2013 that changed patent priority from ""first to invent"" to ""first to file."" The trouble in this case is that Zhang's filings may contain inventions made both before and after March 16, complicating interpretation of which rules apply to the patent. Zhang's argument is that although Doudna's group showed an earlier use of the building blocks of CRISPR/Cas9, he first applied it in the actual target system, the eukaryotic cell. Doudna's argument is that her earlier use of the technology and filing of a patent establishes priority, and that Zhang's lab may have misrepresented when they developed key steps of the method. Other parties are also claiming a share of the credit for discovering CRISPR. At stake is the right to own the CRISPR/Cas9 enterprise, technology that would be licensed out to laboratories that want to engage in gene editing. Several groups, including Doudna and Zhang, have started gene editing companies that, together, have raised more than $1 billion in funding. The patent could be worth an untold amount of money, given the excitement and promise of CRISPR/Cas9. Opening motions in the case were filed in March. On November 17, 2016, a three-judge panel will hear oral arguments. A decision could take months, however, and any appeals could extend the process of rendering a final judgment. Will a decision be issued in the CRISPR/Cas9 patent interference case by the end of 2017 that overturns Zhang's 2014 patent? This questions will resolve as positive if the US Patent and Trademark Office three-judge panel issues its decision regarding the rights to the CRISPR/Cas9 patent on or before December 31, 2017, and that decision overturns at least some claims of the Zhang 2014 patent. This does not speak to appeals of the decision, and the question resolves as negative if a settlement or other event precludes judgement, or if the judgement confers some benefits to Doudna but leaves all claims in the original Zhang patent standing.","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Biological Sciences – Cell and Molecular Biology', 'Law – Patents', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine', 'Patents – Biotech', 'Biological Sciences – Bioengineering']"

Airships have been around since the 1900s, but they have struggled to find their niche among faster, smaller, and safer aircraft. Early zeppelin pioneers envisioned airships filling the skies as a major form of transportation, and the Empire State Building was even designed to accommodate them but the 1937 Hindenburg disaster quashed that dream. (Seemingly every movie ever envisioning an alternative timeline for the US has zeppelins all over!) Airships haven't died out completely, though. The Goodyear blimp is one popular example. (Terminology note: A blimp is an airship with a non-rigid envelope, supported only by the pressure of the enclosed lighter-than-air gas. Semi-rigid or rigid envelope frames are called Zeppelins.) Since 2006, Lockheed Martin has been developing a semi-rigid airship called the LMH-1. The three-lobed airship, filled with helium, is designed as a cargo ship that can deliver up to 47,000 pounds of cargo and 19 passengers to any place in the world without a need for paved roads or a landing runway. Today, such sites are typically accessed by helicopter. But the LMH-1's operating cost is estimated as 7-10 times less than a helicopter. The airship promises access to the two-thirds of the earth's land area inaccessible by paved roads. Lockheed Martin's target markets for the LMH-1 are the oil, gas, and mining industries. Mine and well sites can be located in remote areas, and companies must either build the costly and environmentally damaging infrastructure to access the sites, or deliver people and materials by helicopter. Airships provide a cheaper alternative. All they need is a 2,400 foot landing area, less than half a mile long. Using an air cushion landing system, the LMH-1 can land on water as well. In parallel, UK-based Hybrid Air Vehicles has developed the Airlander 10, a similar airship that was certified for flight in April 2016. The Airlander 10 can carry up to 22,000 pounds of cargo. In March 2016, Straightline Aviation placed an order for 12 LMH-1 airships, at a cost of $40 million each. (By comparison, Boeing's heavy-lift Chinook cargo helicopter costs $38.5 million.) Deliveries are expected in 2018. Although Straightline is still working to acquire customers in the oil, gas, and mining industries, the company is targeting Alaskan oilfields formerly accessible only by ice roads. Lockheed Martin expects to produce around 500 airships in the next ten years. Despite all these positive signs, however, bringing a major new type of aircraft into use is no small feat. Will an oil, gas, or mining company employ hybrid airship transportation by the end of 2018? To resolve positively, a credible media story or corporate announcement must indicate that a company engaged in oil, gas, or mineral extraction has begun using an LMH-1, Airlander 10, or other hybrid airship for commercial operations on or before December 31, 2018.

907,Will participation in the 2016 Globe at Night campaign (which will be announced on the Globe at Night Real-time Interactive Infographic) be greater than that of 2015?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M287,"Before artificial skyglow from industrialization, early humans used the stars as navigation during migration, to plant crops for survival, and even created impressively accurate calendars by studying the occurrences of celestial events. Unfortunately, human activities are causing an increasing amount of light pollution, which prevent some populations at various locations on Earth from seeing the night sky as it once was. Mainly arising from urban areas, the production of excessive light due to inefficiency and unnecessity has significant negative effects. A fairly comprehensive and quantitative assessment of light pollution is described in this article published by the AAAS. With the help of light pollution propagation software, data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, and measurements made by the Sky Quality Meter, a team of researcher created the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, finding that the Milky Way is not visible for over one-third of humanity! This includes 60% of Europeans and about 80% of North Americans. In some entire (small) countries such as Singapore and San Marino have the Galaxy is entirely blocked. To help reduce this pollution, several programs have started to promote awareness and provide suggested solutions. This include organizations advocating smart light laws and policies as well as efforts by various astronomical centers such as the Mont-Mégantic Observatory and the David Dunlap Observatory. However, light pollution currently is not as well advocated as other types pollutions such as air, water, even noise pollution. The international dark-sky association is one of the leading organizations promoting public awareness on light pollution by inviting citizen-scientist to take measurements of night sky brightness using a smartphone or a computer. This citizen-science campaign named Globe at Night has been collecting data since 2006. The total number of observations has been increasing almost for every year. Thus far, Globe at Night has received 9132 observations as of writing. For the year of 2015 there were a total number of 23053 observations made from people of 104 different countries. Although advocacy against light pollution still remains relatively weak, we can monitor an increase in popularity of the issue and the number of people getting involved.

908,"By start of 2019, will a credible media report emerge that a case of TR4 has been detected in Latin America?","['yes', 'no']",no,M288,"Since the 1990s, the Tropical Race 4 strain of Panama disease has been destroying banana crops around the world. The fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense) operates as a soil pathogen, infecting the banana plant through its root system. It is easily spread through the transportation of contaminated dirt, and there is no known cure. Tropical Race 4 was first detected in Taiwan and has since spread across southeast Asia as well as northern Australia, Mozambique, Jordan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. The fast and widespread progression of the disease has a historical precedent. In the first half of the nineteenth century, an earlier variant of Panama disease wreaked havoc on the export banana plantations of Latin America and the Caribbean, which were dedicated to the growth of a single species, the Gros Michel. After the near-extinction of Gros Michel, production shifted to the Cavendish, a more resistant banana. Representing 99% of the global banana market, the monoculture of the Cavendish renders the world’s supply of the fruit particularly vulnerable to diseases like TR4. TR4 has the potential to wipe out not only the Cavendish, but many local varieties of banana and plantain that are crucial to the diets of people around the world. TR4 has not been detected in the Americas, but scientists warn that it is likely to disseminate further via the spread of contaminated plant material, soil, tools, or footwear. Should it reach Latin America, where at least 70% of the world’s bananas are grown, there is potential for a second global banana crisis. By start of 2019, will a credible media report emerge that a case of TR4 has been detected in Latin America? For positive resolution, the infection must be of a banana tree, and should include the reported (or implied) destruction of at least one banana tree in an effort to contain the fungus.","['Industry – Agriculture', 'Biology – Infectious Disease', 'Biological Sciences – Ecological and Environmental Biology']"
909,"Will the results of the VITAL study support a connection between daily supplements of vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids and decreased risk of cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people with no prior history of these illnesses?","['yes', 'no']",no,M289,"The NIH-funded Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) tracks 25,874 men and women across the U.S. over five years, investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk for developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these illnesses. The trial is scheduled to end October 2017. Research on the health effects of vitamin D, which humans primarily obtain from exposure to sunlight, has yielded mixed results, with strong claims being made by both advocates and skeptics. Some studies show inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and a range of diseases including cancer and diabetes; others indicate no significant connection. The health effects of omega-3 fatty acids are similarly uncertain. Since the 1970s, fish oil supplements (a common dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids) have been linked to increased cardiovascular health and a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, but most large clinical trials show no notable benefits. VITAL’s research leaders propose that the study’s size, scope, and rigor will more clearly determine the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 supplements. Will the results of the VITAL study support a connection between daily supplements of vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids and decreased risk of cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people with no prior history of these illnesses? A positive resolution holds if the results of the VITAL study, published after the study's close in October 2017, show that a daily supplement of either 2,000 IU of vitamin D or 1 gram of fish oil reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, and/or heart disease compared with a placebo, with a statistical significance of 95% or greater.","['Biology – Medicine – Clinical Trials', 'Biological Sciences – Cell and Molecular Biology', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine']"
910,"Will a clinical trial be entered into the US database with a start date prior to 1/1/2018, to test the use of varespladib and/or varespladib methyl as snake venom antidotes in humans?","['yes', 'no']",no,M290,"A team of independent researchers led by Dr. Matthew Lewin at Ophirex, Inc. is working to develop a universal antidote to snakebite. Snakes bite around 5 million people each year, resulting in about 100,000 deaths worldwide. Bites are traditionally treated with antivenoms, which are snake-specific, expensive, temperature-sensitive, and often require medical expertise to administer, conditions that make snakebite difficult to treat outside a hospital. An effective antidote, in contrast, would be both heat-stable and broadly effective, interfering with venom’s destructive biochemical effects, which might include paralysis, excessive clotting or bleeding, necrosis, or a combination. Lewin’s research team has identified varespladib and varespladib methyl, off-patent drugs originally developed as an anti-inflammatory, as potential antidotes. These drugs inhibit an enzyme called sPLA2, which is produced in the human body during inflammation and is also a component of snake venom. The drugs have been tested in humans for other uses, but never obtained FDA approval. Early research shows that the drugs are effective in neutralizing sPLA2 in a large variety of snake venoms. In preliminary rodent studies, rats who received varespladib treatments 1-5 minutes after lethal doses of snake venom all went on to survive at least 24 hours. No human trials have yet been undertaken, though Lewin conducted a UCSF-approved trial on himself in April 2013.

911,"Will TAME secure enough funding, public or private, to proceed by October 1, 2017?","['yes', 'no']",no,M291,"Advancing age brings with it a host of health risks, and while modern medicine works to treat many of the conditions associated with aging, no therapy is yet approved to treat aging as an underlying condition. Slow aging, some researchers say, and you can extend a person's ""healthspan,"" or years of relative health. Delaying aging could also delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, cognitive decline, and other conditions. To spur development of anti-aging therapeutics, however, researchers must first convince the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve aging as a disease or pharmaceutical target, also called an ""indication."" A trial balloon in this effort is a study called Targeting Aging with Metformin, or ""TAME."" The study, led by Nir Barzilai of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, aims to enroll 3,000 people in a double-blind controlled experiment to see if the diabetes drug metformin can extend the human healthspan and lifespan. Metformin, considered the first line of defense against Type 2 diabetes, lowers blood sugar and increases insulin sensitivity. At around 35 cents per pill, it's relatively inexpensive. Studies have found an intriguing side effect of metformin, however. The drug increased the lifespan of worms and some mice. A UK study of patient data suggested a possible lowered risk of cardiovascular disease in metformin-treated diabetes patients. Another study of patient data suggests that diabetes patients in their 70s, treated with metformin, experienced around 15% less mortality than their diabetic peers treated with other methods. Scientists think the drug may reduce inflammation and slow the process of cell senescence, a component of aging. Although TAME shows promise, and the protocol was approved by the FDA in June 2016, the program is unfunded. Costs are expected to reach $50-65 million. Without funding, TAME cannot proceed. Funding could come from private or public sources. Pharmaceutical companies have the deep pockets that TAME needs, but may be reluctant to invest in the study since a previous anti-aging effort cost more than $700 million and has been fruitless so far in clinical trials. And, with metformin already established as a drug, pharmaceutical companies cannot exclusively profit from it as they would with a newly developed therapeutic. Another possible funding source is a line in the US Department of Defense's budget called the ""Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program,"" (PRMRP) which distributes funding for basic medical research. For 2016, Congress appropriated $278 million for the program. Visitors to TAME's website are encouraged to write to their congressional representative to encourage further appropriations of $13 million per year for the PRMRP, funds that could support the initial years of TAME. According to the House Committee on the Budget, any action on the FY 2017 budget will be in place by June 30, 2017. PRMRP proposals are typically submitted in the spring, in advance of the fiscal year beginning on October 1. Will TAME secure enough funding, public or private, to proceed by October 1, 2017? To resolve positively, a credible media story or TAME-affiliated press release must report that the program has received at least $13 million in funding, enough to commence the first year of the study, regardless of the funding source, on or before October 1, 2017.","['Technological Advances', 'Biological Sciences – Cell and Molecular Biology', 'Biology – Medicine – Clinical Trials']"

In June 2016, a research team at the University of Massachusetts Medical School published findings that interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), small proteins found in the human body, can significantly block infection by the Zika virus. In particular, the team identified the protein IFITM3, already known to play an important role in the human immune system, as an early front line defender against Zika. IFITM3, found in nearly all human cells, bolsters the cell membrane against viral penetration. The study found that IFITM3 levels in test cells were inversely correlated with the rate of infection by Zika. The team’s next step will be to test the susceptibility of IFITM3-deficient mice to Zika infection, with the hope of eventually developing an anti-viral therapy based on IFITM3 that can be used to fight the Zika outbreak.

In 2012, Kurzweil was hired as Google’s Director of Engineering, with a focus on projects involving machine learning and natural language processing. At a May 2016 conference held by Singularity University, Kurzweil announced that his Google team is working on a chatbot to be released later this year. One of the bots will be named Danielle, after the titular character of Kurzweil’s yet-to-be-released novel. Kurzweil described a chatbot that, given substantial writing samples from a unique user, could be personalized to adopt the writer’s “style, personality, and ideas”. The anticipated bots will be able to hold conversations that are “interesting,” though not yet near the sophistication of human-to-human communication. The story broke via a video from the conference posted on technology and culture website theverge.com. The video has since been removed due to copyright restrictions by Singularity University; no official announcement of Kurzweil's project has been made by Google. Kurzweil’s announcement comes at a time of chatbot development among tech giants. The CEO of Microsoft recently declared that chatbots will revolutionize computing, although Microsoft suffered an embarrassing setback in March when its Twitter chatbot had to be disabled in less than a day after learning hate speech from users. Facebook’s Messenger app features over 11,000 chatbots for users to converse with.

One-way travel to Mars can take several months, compared to three days when going to the moon, and the launch window comes around only once every two years. Astronauts traveling to Mars are exposed to high radiation levels, cramped living conditions for an extended time, the detrimental health effects of microgravity, and lack of access to advanced medical care in case something goes wrong. And if fictionalized accounts of missions to Mars (and even some real robotic missions) have taught us anything, it's that the chances of something going wrong are high. Despite the challenges, Earth has had its sights on Mars for centuries. In 1948, NASA rocket guru Wernher von Braun published the first technical analysis of what it would take to go to Mars. Since then, dozens of plans have been put forward, each with a launch date around 20-30 years in the future. NASA is actively preparing for a Mars mission. The Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System rocket, both still in development and testing, are designed to be able to go to Mars. The current target launch date for a manned Mars mission is around 2035. Private enterprise, already in the business of sending cargo to the International Space Station, has its own designs on sending humans to Mars. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, says he's working on a blueprint for a Mars mission that would launch in 2025 - a full decade before NASA. He has dropped hints about a methane-powered rocket booster and a crew module called the Mars Colonial Transporter designed to take permanent colonists, not just interloping astronauts, to the Red Planet. Because of the challenges involved in going to Mars, Musk has repeatedly delayed unveiling his full blueprint and timeline. In January 2015, he promised a reveal by the end of that year, then pushed it to early 2016.

It is very simple in its formulation - a finite set of internal states, an infinitely long tape on which characters can be written, and a finite set of transition rules dictating how a current state and current character map to: writing a new character, possibly moving the tape, and changing from one of the internal states to another. Although simple and stripped-down, the functions it can compute are equivalent to those of other models of digital computers under assumptions of unlimited time and ""tape"". Theorems can be proven characterizing the behavior of very simple Turing machines - for example, a machine with only one internal state that (when it is in that state) prints a character and moves the tape ahead will never stop. It's also known as a consequence of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem that there exist Turing machines complex enough that their behavior cannot be characterized by proof given the usual axioms of set theory (ZFC with the Axiom of Choice). In May 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson published a paper demonstrating a Turing machine with 7,918 states (one tape, two possible symbols) that has behavior that is unprovable in a particular sense: the machine cannot be proven in ZFC to either run forever or not run forever, assuming that a slightly stronger formulation of set theory (Stationary Ramsey Property) is itself consistent. In his blogpost announcing the paper, Aaronson speculated on how few states a Turing machine could have with this kind of unprovable behavior, and invited readers to improve upon this bound. This question will resolve in the positive if, before July 1 2017, Scott Aaronson links from his blog to a paper that claims to have constructed a binary-tape-symbol Turing machine with fewer than 100 states satisfying this standard of unprovability, and Aaronson declares himself to be satisfied with the construction.",['Computer Science – Theoretical Computer Science']

There is unambiguous evidence that climate change, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (as well as other greenhouse gases), is responsible for the relentless upward trend. Nonetheless, stochastic variations do lend a short-term veneer of unpredictability to near-term measurements. A recently closed Metaculus question that asked whether 2016 will break the global heat record was quite popular -- 742 predictions were registered, ascribing an 85% chance of going over the top. Given the interest, it seems reasonable to roll the question out for the coming year: Will 2017 again set a new record? Or will it fall off the recent record-setting pace?

The past year has seen two significant mergers: between Dow Chemical and DuPont in December 2015, and between Syngenta and China National Chemical Corp. in February 2016. In May 2016, German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company Bayer approached American multinational agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto with a proposed acquisition. Bayer is a leading producer of pesticides, while Monsanto dominates the global market in seeds and crop genetics; together, Bayer proposed, the companies could create “a truly global agriculture leader.” Monsanto rejected Bayer’s first bid of $62 billion ($122 per share), then rejected a revised bid of $64 billion ($125 per share)—a move some analysts considered overconfident. A top Bayer shareholder floated the possibility of a hostile bid to put pressure on Monsanto, though the company affirmed its commitment to a friendly negotiated deal. In early August, Bayer signed confidentiality agreements to conduct due diligence on Monsanto, a process that is expected to take several weeks. Bayer’s examination of Monsanto’s financial accounts is a crucial step in any possible deal, but no guarantee has been made by either side. The stakes for this deal are high: a merger between these two multinationals is considered the final step of the agricultural sector’s massive consolidation. Critics warn that the merger could have devastating effects on the global food supply and agricultural market. A white paper written by two former employees of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division argues that the deal is “presumptively anticompetitive” and that it violates a 2008 court order against Monsanto, concluding that “the antitrust enforcers must not allow this merger to proceed.” The European Commission is also keeping a close eye on the deal and promises to closely examine any merger for violations of European competition policy. In a broader context, Monsanto in particular has long been a target of both legal controversy and popular protest for its large-scale development of genetically modified organisms, the health and environmental effects of its products, and its history of aggressive litigation against small farmers.

On August 16th, the New York Times, along with a number of other news outlets, reported on the release, by an entity referring to itself as the Shadow Brokers, of a 256 Mb compressed archive containing roughly 4,000 files of various types. According to this security response post from Symantec, the archive contains installation scripts, configuration files and exploits targeting a range of routers and firewall tools. The leaked files have been linked to a sophisticated actor known as the Equation Group, which itself appears, according to experts, to be associated with the U.S. National Security Agency's highly classified Tailored Access Operations unit. The files appear to be of considerable significance. Cisco Systems, for example, notes that the leak illuminates a high-severity ""zero-day"" vulnerability that had gone undetected for years in every supported version of the company's Adaptive Security Appliance firewall. The released files appear to date from mid-2013, around the time of Edward Snowden's leak of NSA-related documents.

920,Will the DC federal court grant class certification for an ongoing lawsuit against the government for “charging excessive fees to access court records through PACER”?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M317,"In April 2016, three nonprofits—the Alliance for Justice, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Veterans Services Program—filed a class-action lawsuit against the government, alleging that the Administrative Office of the US Courts (AO) has been violating the E-Government Act of 2002 by charging excessive fees to access court records through PACER. PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) describes itself as “an electronic public access service that allows users to obtain case and docket information online from [federal courts]”. The AO charges a fee to download documents on PACER. When web access to PACER opened in 1998, the AO charged $0.07 per page. Until 2002, a federal statute required the AO to charge a fee to access PACER: [italics added] The Judicial Conference shall hereafter prescribe reasonable fees […] for collection by the courts […] for access to information available through automatic data processing equipment. However, in 2002, the E-Government Act was signed into law and amended this statute to its current form by “striking ‘shall hereafter’ and inserting ‘may, only to the extent necessary,’”. Regardless, in 2005, the AO increased the fee from $0.07 to $0.08 per page, and in 2012, to $0.10 per page. In their motion for class certification, the plaintiffs in this suit allege that “[these fees] far exceed the cost of providing the records, and thus violate the E-Government Act”, and state: [emphasis in original] The E-Government Act’s sponsor says that the AO is violating the law. In early 2009, Senator Joe Lieberman (the E-Government Act’s sponsor) wrote the AO “to inquire if [it] is complying” with the law. […] [In 2010], in his annual letter to the Appropriations Committee, Senator Lieberman expressed his “concerns” about the AO’s interpretation [of the E-Government Act]. “[D]espite the technological innovations that should have led to reduced costs in the past eight years,” he observed, the “cost for these documents has gone up.” It has done so because the AO uses the fees to fund “initiatives that are unrelated to providing public access via PACER.” He reiterated his view that this is “against the requirement of the E-Government Act,” which permits “a payment system that is used only to recover the direct cost of distributing documents via PACER.” Other technology-related projects, he stressed, “should be funded through direct appropriations.” As of August 16, there are two pending motions in this suit: The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification to represent “[a]ll individuals and entities who have paid fees for the use of PACER within the past six years”, stating that on behalf of this class, they will seek “a full refund of excess fees charged within the [past six years], plus a declaration that the fees violate the E-Government Act”. The government filed a motion to “dismiss this action for failure to state a claim within this Court’s jurisdiction and under the ‘first-to-file’ rule”, or for “summary judgment in its favor […] because there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law”. The parties have filed the following documents relating to these motions: Apr 21: Plaintiffs filed complaint against the government. May 2: Plaintiffs filed motion to certify class action and proposed this order. Jul 25: Government opposed plaintiffs' motion. Aug 4: Plaintiffs replied in support of their motion. Jun 27: Government filed motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Jul 29: Plaintiffs opposed government's motion. Aug 16: Government replied in support of its motion. On August 16, the court granted a joint motion for a three-phased schedule of proceedings. Following this schedule, the suit is currently in phase I and will move on to phase II if “the Motion to Dismiss is denied, and the Court grants certification of a class, in whole or in part”.

921,Will the SunShot Initiative's goals of decreasing the price of solar power by 75% between 2010 and 2020 be met?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M321,"America's shift toward renewable energy leans heavily on solar power, a technology that can be installed on homes and relies on a source of energy that is clean and essentially unlimited. Solar power utilizes photovoltaic technology to convert light energy into electricity. Once the solar panels are manufactured, they produce no carbon dioxide emissions. Installations range from single-family rooftop residential panels all the way up to large utility-scale solar farms. To help clean energy gain wide adoption and to spur the creation of jobs in the green economy, the U.S. Department of Energy launched the SunShot initiative with the goal of decreasing the price of solar power by 75% between 2010 and 2020. In 2010, residential solar power installations cost $6.20 per watt (direct current), commercial installations ran $5.00 per watt, and utility-scale installations cost $4.10 per watt. SunShot, through targeted project funding opportunities, seeks to reduce the cost of solar technology, reduce the cost of integrating solar panels with electrical grids, and accelerate the spread of solar power throughout the country. By 2016, SunShot reports that the goal is within reach. Residential systems are averaging $3.21 per watt, and utility-scale installations are as low as $1.24 per watt. Will the SunShot Initiative's goals of decreasing the price of solar power by 75% between 2010 and 2020 be met? To resolve as positive, a credible news outlet, Department of Energy press release, Solar Energies Industries Association report, or other public report must report that the average prices for installed solar panels is at or below $1.50 per watt (DC) for residential installations, $1.25 for commercial, and $1 for utility-scale installations on or before December 31, 2020.","['Technological Advances', 'Technology – Energy']"
922,Will language loss rates increase by the end of the decade?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M322,"Linguists estimate that humans use around 7,000 languages. Only a few are considered global or widespread languages. The others, although spoken by small regional groups, are often key to the identity and heritage of their respective cultures. Only 102 languages are considered ""International"" or ""National"" and are spoken by 60% of the world's population, despite comprising only 1.4% of all documented modern languages. Globalization, including internet connectivity, international trade, and international travel elevate the importance of these top languages, particularly the six languages with the most speakers: Chinese, Spanish, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Portuguese. Globalization can endanger languages as well because rising generations learn regional and national languages instead of local or traditional dialects. Estimates of endangered languages range from around 20% to around 50% of all documented languages. Hundreds of languages have already been lost, and the current language death rate is between four and six languages per year. Ethnologue, an annual report on language status, reports that 360 languages reported as ""living"" in their first 1951 report have since been classified as ""extinct."" 423 languages are considered ""nearly extinct,"" meaning that the only user are aging speakers who have little opportunity to use the language in everyday life. But technology can also help preserve and revitalize languages, with digital documentation and language resources aiming to save some of the most critically endangered languages. Linguists also track languages that are ""reawakening,"" including seven in the United States currently enjoying a resurgence. Will language loss rates increase by the end of the decade? This question will resolve as positive if the 2021 edition of Ethnologue lists more than 380 extinct languages since 1951, which would indicate a language loss rate greater than four per year, and an acceleration in language loss.",['Social issues']

While not every form of blindness is treatable or preventable, the article lists several methods in development to restore at least some vision. Although the goal is to end preventable blindness before 2020, the technology is still in testing and the greatest barrier is delivering treatments to the people who need them. Two treatment methods focus on repairing damage in the retina itself. Gene therapy targets genetic disorders in eyes by inserting a functional replacement gene into a carrier virus, which incorporates itself into retinal cells. Stem cell therapy aims to replenish damaged or degraded retinas by placing targeted populations of stem cells, which can differentiate into any cell type in the body, in a position to form new rods and cones, the cells essential to sight. Gene therapy is already in clinical use in patients, while stem cell therapy is still in the trial stage. Another route is a retinal implant. Bionic eyes work just like natural eyes, by collecting and focusing light and relaying the light signals to the brain. Only a handful of people have received an implant so far, and the images produced are little more than areas of light and dark - but the technology is improving. The World Health Organization reports that 80% of all blindness is preventable or treatable and that the only major remaining non-treatable cause of blindness is age-related macular degeneration. Current treatment efforts can only slow the course of the disease and cannot restore lost sight. But stem cell trials. . . Will age-related macular degeneration be preventable or treatable by 2020?

924,Will the total time devoted to questions (and answers) directly referring to AI and/or robotic automation of labor in the presidential debates be less than 5 minutes?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M325,"Dramatic recent progress in narrow (and arguably general) purpose AI has led to a myriad of practical but nascent technologies including autonomous vehicles, automated call-answering systems, highly automated factories, medical and legal expert systems, and so on. While the automation of repetitive physical labor is an old story, the advent of AI/robotic systems to perform essentially any repetitive physical labor, as well as many non-repetitive physical tasks and also repetitive or non-repetitive cognitive tasks, is likely to dramatically change the dynamics governing human labor and its place in the global economy. In their book, Brynjolfsson & McAfee argue that we are in the early stages of this process, but that it is already underway and has contributed significantly to income inequality and other difficulties in the labor pool. It is thus quite possible that the cause of much of the anger and frustration being channeled by the Trump (and previously Sanders) campaign is fundamentally caused by an automation process that is likely just getting started. However, while a significant topic of conversation in tech and some economic circles, and while politicians love to talk about jobs, the automation of labor has played little to no role in the presidential election thus far. Will this continue to be the case? We ask: Will the total time devoted to questions (and answers) directly referring to AI and/or robotic automation of labor in the presidential debates be less than 5 minutes? The presidential debate schedule currently calls for three debates of around 90 minutes apiece. Resolution is positive if less than 5 minutes of this ~270 minutes is devoted to questions and answers directly discussing AI and robotic automation of labor.

The most prominent world population forecast is produced every two years by the United Nations. In their latest version from 2015 the world population is, in the most likely scenario, projected to continue growing thru 2100. On the other hand, the 2014 population projection from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis attempts a more refined analysis of the role of female education in demographic transition and forecasts a population peak before 2100.

Deutsche Bank is also substantially leveraged, it has exposure to a wide array of derivative contracts, and it faces an environment in which its profitability lags the cost of capital.

Game-playing AI systems have been steadily advancing both in highly ruled-based (but difficult!) games like Chess and Go, and videogames in which the AI system is just given the same input and output stream as a human player and must analyze the video. For several years, an Angry Birds AI competition has been held to evaluate and encourage game-playing ML systems to play Angry Birds. In this competition the entrants are provided ""a basic game playing software that includes a computer vision module, a trajectory planning module, and the game interface that works with the Chrome version of Angry Birds.""

Simple variants of poker have been conquered by the bots, but more complex versions are still being defended. Texas HoldEm is the most popular form of poker, and its simplest variant (Heads-up Limit HoldEm) is widely believed to have been solved, with poker programs consistently outperforming human players. This variant is simple in two ways: ""Heads-up"" means that there are only two players at the table, and ""Limit"" means that bets and raises can only be made in fixed amounts, with a limited number of reraises. The least restricted version of HoldEm is multi-player No Limit Holdem, where there are multiple players at a table, and bets/reraises can range freely between a minimum amount and the entire amount of a player's chips. To date in 2016, humans have eked out narrow victories in Heads-up No Limit Holdem, and no computer program has as yet made a serious showing in a multi-player No Limit HoldEm challenge. This dominance of the felt by humans is no doubt temporary, and victory by the machines is inevitable. When will humans be forced to acknowledge not only that they are descended from fish, but that fish they remain (as far as silicon-based sharks are concerned)?

It's a disease of the pancreas, an organ that, among other functions, monitors the body's blood sugar levels and releases the hormone insulin as needed to keep blood sugar under control. Diabetes results from a malfunction in the pancreas, requiring people with the disease to monitor their own blood sugar levels and deliver insulin as needed, either through a hypodermic syringe or an insulin pump, which requires user input as to when and how much insulin to deliver. In September 2016, a device from Medtronic gained FDA approval as the first artificial pancreas, an automated insulin pump that automatically carries out blood sugar detection and insulin delivery without the user needing to manually program a pump. It is designed around existing insulin pump technology but with an additional algorithms to automatically regulate blood sugar. This is a boon to people with diabetes, particularly for night-time insulin delivery. Some human input is still required, but only for large meals, exercise, and recalibrating the device with manual blood sugar testing every 12 hours. Medtronic's device is a milestone in diabetes therapy (and resolved a previous version of this question before it even got launched!), but the first artificial pancreas will be far from the last.

936,Will the annual maximum Antarctic ozone hole size begin its recovery by 2020?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M347,"One of the prominent environmental storylines of the 1980s and 1990s was the hole in the ozone layer. After a sweeping ban on ozone-depleting chemicals in 1987, the degradation of the ozone layer appears to have slowed, and is now poised for recovery. Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms. A layer of ozone sits about 6 miles above the earth, in the stratosphere, and protects earth from harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. Ozone reacts very easily with other chemicals, however. Chlorine and bromine can knock an oxygen atom off of an ozone molecule, leaving an oxygen atom that cannot perform the same protective function as ozone. Chloroflurocarbons, chemicals used in refrigeration, are particularly effective in destroying ozone molecules. After a seasonal hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985, however, international cooperation yielded an agreement in 1987 to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. Since then, the amount of chlorine in the atmosphere that poses a danger to ozone has peaked and is beginning to decline. The size of the ozone hole reached its largest recorded extent in 2006, at 30 million square kilometers, but hasn't surpassed that number since. A running five-year average of ozone hole size from NASA data shows values ranging from 20.7-24 million square kilometers post-2000. The size of the hole appears to have plateaued. Forecasts point to a slow, steady recovery by mid-century, but there is not yet convincing evidence that the ozone hole has actually decreased in size. Will the annual maximum Antarctic ozone hole size begin its recovery by 2020?

A common method for detail mapping of the sea floor is via sonar based measurements. Generally, sonar systems aboard ships can map the ocean floor to a resolution of ~100 m in deepest regions (~11000 m depth) and a resolution of ~10 m nearshore (~10 m depth) across a narrow strip below the ship. Thus far only ~7% of the sea floor has been mapped to this resolution, and some very small areas has been mapped to extremely high level detail, of 1 m or less, using the same method. For each XPRIZE competing team, their mappings must have a vertical resolution of 0.5 m and horizontal resolution of 5 m, with a minimum 20% mapping at 2,000 m depth and 50% mapping at 4,000 m depth of competition area, in round one and round two, respectively. Here is the breakdown of the prizes. Of the entire $7M prize, i) The two teams with highest scores for the high resolution seafloor mapping and high definition imagery after final round will be awarded Grand Prize.

Planet Nine was among a handful of recent examples. In mid-January of 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- kicked the news media into high gear by predicting the existence of a new, but as-yet unseen, planet in the outer solar system. They asserted that Neptune et al.'s erstwhile sibling has an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the planet count back up to nine. Batygin and Brown's paper, despite containing a bracing dose of secular perturbation theory, has been downloaded over 300,000 times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Follow-up papers by (among others) Fienga et al., Holman and Payne and Malhotra et al. have added credibility and detail to the Planet Nine hypothesis. Based on the host of recent results, Metaculus now calculates a most probable current sky position for Planet Nine of RA=2h, Dec=0 deg. This area of the sky is currently close to optimal visibility for a planet at opposition. At the most probable location, the planet's current distance would be r~600 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 21. A number of groups have engaged in the hunt, and there is something of an emerging consensus that if the planet is to be found, it'll be found sooner rather than later. As an example, Mike Brown gives sixteen months.

941,Will China's debt accumulation lead to a crash in 2017?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M366,"Recently there have been several warnings on the volume of corporate debt in China (by the IMF, Financial Times, etc.), which is likely to affect the country's financial sector because State Owned Enterprises under stress are being ""bailed out"" by State Owned Banks e.g. through debt restructuring or loan-for-equity swaps. Indeed the amount of outstanding credit is not only in terms of credit/GDP, but in credit/GDP gap (the deviation from the trend). This measure has been defended as the best predictor of financial crises. As a result, some have even started to argue that 2017 will be the year things come to head – just as other important financial crises took place in years ending in 7. On the other hand, the Chinese government has recognized the high amount of leverage in the country’s corporate sector, and launched policy measures to reduce leverage (e.g. M&Es, liquidate zombie companies). While analysts do acknowledge these measures, some argue that they will not be enough. Hence, a key question in financial markets at present is: Will China’s debt accumulation lead to a crash in 2017? Resolution is positive if both: China's rate of GDP growth reported for 2017 is less than 5%, and The highest point on Google trends, searched in California, for ""China financial Crisis"" hits twice the value that it attained in 2015.",['Finance – markets']
942,"How important are ""time crystals""?","['yes', 'no']",no,M368,"A hypothetical object called a time crystal was first proposed by Frank Wilczek in 2012. Once just a mathematical curiosity, its existence may have been experimentally confirmed by a team of physicists who observed predicted time crystal behavior in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. The work is reported in a pre-print submitted to arXiv in September 2016. Initially, many doubted that such quantum systems could exist for the unusual property of periodic motion in the ground state. Like ordinary crystals which form repeating patterns in the crystal structure created by spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in three dimensions, time crystals extend to the fourth dimension: time. Observing time crystals would imply observing the breaking of time translation symmetry. Time crystals exhibit repetition (crystalline behavior) in both space and time, and the growth of repeating lattices in time does not consume nor produce any energy despite of perpetual motion in the ground state. But the required spontaneously broken time translation symmetry had not been observed before, and the lack of a precise definition for time crystals created difficulty in the past for realizing such a physical system. Previously, researchers showed that when they considered both the ground state and states in thermal equilibrium, time translation symmetry could not be broken. Later, another team, using the idea of a non-equilibrium driven system, showed time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken in a large class of many-body-localized driven systems with discrete time translation symmetry. A paper on this work titled Floquet Time Crystals was published on August 2016 in Phys. Rev. Lett. The preprint version on arXiv has been cited 9 times as of question writing, as reported by Google Scholar. Will this paper have at least 9 more citations, by the end of 2016? Certainly, the discovery has large implications in the understanding of states of matter in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. It also implies observing time translation symmetry being spontaneously broken for the first time. More citations mean that the paper is achieving greater scientific impact, and this is part of an ongoing small-scale experiment to look at predictions of paper citation rates on various timescales. For the question to resolve positively, a Google Scholar search must report a minimum of 18 citations of the paper Floquet Time Crystals on or before Dec 31st, 2016.",['Physical Sciences – Condensed Matter and Materials Science']
943,Will an ultrasound-based Alzheimer's treatment begin clinical trials in humans in 2017?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M369,"Millions of people worldwide are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, a neurological disease that breaks down brain functions, eventually leading to death. Alzheimer's is most prevalent in older people, with the risk of developing the disease doubling every five years after age 65. The main culprits identified by scientists are called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Both are dense, sticky masses that cluster and interfere with neuron function. Existing medications for Alzheimer's disease attempt to treat the symptoms and stave off further damage – in both cases the effect is modest. There is no current cure. In 2015, an Australian team published the results of a study showing that focused ultrasound waves restored memory function in mice whose brains contained Alzheimer's-type plaques. The sound waves opened up the blood-brain barrier and activated cells that typically clean up cellular wastes. The cells, called microglia, cleared away the plaques, restoring memory function in 75 percent of the mice, with no apparent detrimental effects. The team hopes to begin human trials of the non-invasive treatment in 2017. Will an ultrasound-based Alzheimer's treatment begin clinical trials in humans in 2017? For this question to resolve as positive, the Australian clinical trial registry must report the commencement of a trial using scanning ultrasound to clear amyloid plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles in humans on or before December 31, 2017.","['Biology – Medicine – Clinical Trials', 'Scientific Discoveries']"

This valuable sample may survive warming to room temperature and the DAC could be extracted from the cryostat for greatly enhanced observation and further study. Another possibility is to cool to liquid helium temperatures and slowly release the load to see if SMH is metastable.

Rev. Lett. by a group physicists at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, reporting findings from their research on the possible existence of dark photons – a hypothetical elementary particle first proposed in 2008 as a force carrier particle for dark matter. Not much attention was gained with this paper, which discussed a potential new particle of mass ~ 17 MeV found via radioactive decay anomaly. At the time the particle type was not determined. Later, another team of physicists from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) examined the work done by the Hungarian team along with relevant results from previous experiments. Calling it the protophobic X boson, their findings suggest the particle may not be a matter particle nor is it a dark photon. Instead, it could be a force carrier acting in a range comparable to that of an atomic nucleus and only with electrons and neutrons. Their work is reported in a paper published in August 2016 in Phys. Rev. Lett. SPIRES currently lists 18 citations to the Feng et al. paper The never-before-seen characteristic of the protophobic X boson implies the possible existence of a fifth fundamental force of nature in addition to the four known forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear force. Naturally, the announcement intrigued the physics community; while some theorists greeted the news with skepticism, several experiments are now underway to finding conclusive evidence of dark photons, and physics beyond the standard model. As a gauge of this paper's importance and how much attention is being paid to it, we ask: Will the Feng et al. paper increase its citation rate over the next two months?

The project hopes to find other ""Pale Blue Dots"", Earthlike planets with environments that can sustain life. If the pledge amount is met, the $1M will go towards the initial stage of analysis, design, and mission simulations. Project funding will not be provided unless the $1M goal is met by the deadline. A $4M budget is set for the second stage of development, in which technologies will be tested and telescope's design would be completed. The entire mission, with a 2020 launch date, is estimated to cost roughly $50M. The reason behind such a modest budget is that unlike traditional space missions with significantly larger project scopes (such as the Hubble Space Telescope), the only purpose of Project Blue is to create a planet-hunting space telescope, thus making it a high-risk, high-reward mission. Its sole focus on the Alpha Centauri system, while keeping the cost down, is very risky in comparison to a mission that could view hundreds or thousands of stars.

965,Will this first evidence demonstrating direct perception of a single photon by the human eyes initiate more interest to perform similar testing in the near future?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M407,"The question of whether large-scale quantum effects could be in operation in the brain is quite controversial (see for example this argument that decoherence in the brain is ultra fast and this recent question about slower decoherence). Yet it's clear that quantum mechanics operates in the brain, and that many biological processes may well use quantum effects on the small scale in ways that can effect much larger scales. As a fascinating example, it has long been known that the human eye/brain system can detect just a few photons of light, and a recent study has quantified this at an unprecedented level. The experimenting team tested the human eye's sensitivity using technology developed in quantum optics and quantum information studies. In conjuncture with psychophysics protocol, they found that the human eyes have the ability to detect the presence of individual photons with a high success rate. The team performed over 30,000 trials with result published in Nature Communications on July 19, 2016. With such a high-confidence trial, scientists anticipate further testing on humans' ability to directly observe quantum properties via the applied techniques used in the experiment. The findings also raise the question of how biological systems are enabled to attain such sensitivity. Will this first evidence demonstrating direct perception of a single photon by the human eyes initiate more interest to perform similar testing in the near future?

Ordinary space is generally thought to be empty with no effect on the path travelled by light, but in the presence of strong magnetic fields, a quantum effect can emerge and modify the space, as in the case of this neutron star's strong magnetic fields that permeate its surroundings. The team submitted their findings (Mignani et al.) to arXiv in Oct 2016, and published their work in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in Nov. 2016. The researchers analyzed data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and found the boosting effect of vacuum birefringence realized in the affected propagation of light in the space around the neutron star. This is the first direct observational evidence supporting vacuum birefringence effects predicted by QED. The next generation of telescopes, including the European Extremely Large Telescope, will likely participate in future observational tests.

Two days after Verlinde's submission, on Nov 9, 2016, another paper (S. McGaugh et al.) published in Physical Review Letters. Based on an analysis of 153 galaxies, researchers found that any particular dark matter (halo) model was unnecessary to account for observed radial acceleration, while MOND had anticipated such a result more than three decades ago. As of writing, the McGaugh et al. paper, including its previous preprint version on arXiv, has been cited 13 times, according to Google Scholar. In this new paradigm of updating MOND theory, researchers' findings offer an alternate view that dark matter, a mainstay of modern astronomy, may be an illusion.

Of the 2.5 million stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the team claimed that 234 of them exhibit characteristics identical to that of the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) signal predicted by the same group in a previous publication in 2012. Due to the study's controversial conclusions, many are criticizing their report, noting a high likelihood that the observed anomalies may be results of human error, rather than signals emitted by ET. The claim of ETI detection, as an international protocol, requires an exhaustive evaluation of all other possible natural explanations before drawing any conclusions. Independent verifications are required with at least two or more telescopes. The authors have not ruled out other potential explanations, and speculate that the mysterious signal could be due to ""highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars."" But their data came from a small number of stars, centered around the Sun, which have a very narrow spectral range. Currently, the discovery has, according to some commentators, a score of 0 to 1 on the Rio Scale, a ranking system used to evaluate the significance of any observed extraterrestrial phenomena, with 10 signifying a valid and important discovery.

The vote, although a referendum vote to assess the will of the people, did not by itself cause the UK to leave the European Union. The mechanism for doing so is Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, and Brexit does not formally begin until that article is triggered. The Article states that any EU member country can decide to leave the Union by formally notifying the European Council. Upon notification, the exiting country commences a two-year period of negotiation to, in essence, re-negotiate the country's new relationship with the rest of the EU. The final agreement must be ratified by the European Council, in consultation with the European Parliament. Triggering Article 50 is risky by design, however. If the agreement is not ratified within the two-year timeframe, the exiting country goes away empty-handed, with regards to formal relationships with the remaining EU countries. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she will trigger Article 50 by the end of March 2017.

South Korean observers confirmed that such a launch may be imminent. ICBMs are typically defined as capable of traveling more than 5,500 km (3,400 mi). Missiles with shorter ranges are defined as intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the category in which North Korea's successfully-tested Musudan missile falls. Early development of ICBMs by the United States and Russia paralleled the space race, since the same missiles in development to deliver nuclear warheads were also used as launch vehicles in the Mercury and Gemini programs and in the Russian counterparts of the same programs. North Korea's Taepodong rocket, with a range up to 6,000 km, has similarly been used for space launches, although it's unlikely this rocket was designed to carry a nuclear warhead. Instead, North Korea's two ICBMs possibly in development are the KN-08 and the longer-range KN-14.

Each of the nations has asserted territorial claims over portions of the sea and its islands, claims which overlap. At stake is control of the busy fishing and shipping region, as well as the vast estimated oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea floor. The Spratly Islands compose some of the most hotly contested territory. The 14 islands and around 100 reefs and atolls are occupied by military personnel from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Disputes over the South China Sea date back to the 1940s, and continue today. China has emerged as the most aggressive claimant, and has built military fortifications, airstrips, and artificial islands in the sea. In 2011 an Indian military vessel in the sea was warned via radio that it was entering Chinese waters. In July 2016, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ruled in favor of the Philippines that China had no historical right to its claimed territory, typically known as the ""nine-dash-line"" map. Neither China nor Taiwan has accepted the ruling. Comments from world leaders suggest that the territorial disputes in the sea could erupt into armed conflict. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in his confirmation hearings: “We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.” In response, from China's Global Times newspaper: ""If Trump's diplomatic team shapes future Sino-US ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.""

Much as other forms of astronomy collect information by observing visible light, infrared, or x-rays, gravitational-wave astronomy observes the universe via the ripples in space-time that emanate from cosmic events, such as the collision of black holes. In response to the newfound interest in gravitational waves, the European Space Agency chose ""The Gravitational Universe"" as the theme for its L3 mission, slated for a 2034 launch. ESA's call for mission proposals closed in January 2017. One of the proposals submitted is for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a mission that would comprise three spacecraft, arranged in a triangle. As gravitational waves pass by the antenna, the ripples in gravity will change the distance between the points in a manner detectable by the primary spacecraft. The distance between the spacecraft is large – ten times larger than the orbit of the moon. Technology for this proposed mission was proven on a test mission, LISA Pathfinder, which launched in 2015. The smaller craft showed that two test masses could be isolated from all forces but gravity, and that the detector could pick up discrepancies in the laser signal on the minuscule picometer scale. LISA Pathfinder's mission was recently extended to June 2017. The LISA mission has had a turbulent funding history. The mission was first proposed to the ESA in the 1990s and gained additional traction with the participation of NASA, promised in 1997. NASA withdrew in 2011, however, citing budget cuts. ESA then asked the proposed L1 missions, including LISA, to reformulate lower-cost versions. The revamped New Gravitational wave Observatory was passed over for funding in 2012. But the mission's luck changed with the L3 mission proposals. LIGO's discovery prompted a resurgent interest in gravitational wave astronomy and led to the ESA's mission theme. At the same time, LISA Pathfinder had returned successful results, proving out the mission's technology. Finally, NASA rejoined the project, although as a junior partner. (Whether the US contribution will rise to the level of 20% is subject of another question). Will ESA select the LISA mission as its L3 mission, to launch in 2034?

Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals, claiming around 300,000 people per year in the United States. Paul Marik, a doctor in Norfolk, VA developing a new sepsis treatment, says the death rate from the infection is akin to ""three jumbo jets crashing every day."" Currently, hospitals treat sepsis by administering fluids and antibiotics. Marik's treatment involves a mix of corticosteroids and two vitamins - Vitamin B and Vitamin C. The combination, Marik says, boosts the body's reception of the steroids,which relieve the inflammation associated with sepsis. Marik says he's treated 150 patients with his custom combo now, and only one has died of sepsis. Marik's treatment seems miraculous and potentially transformative in the way sepsis is treated - so naturally and rightfully, physicians are wary. A chief concern is that the treatment hasn't been through a randomized double-blind controlled trial, the gold standard of evaluating medical treatments. In such a trial, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment or a placebo, with neither the patient or the doctor aware of who receives what. One physician stated that with the claims Marik has made, even a small study could corroborate them. Ideally, such a study would be carried out at multiple hospitals to ensure the effect could be replicated. Part of doctors' skepticism comes from the history of sepsis treatments. In 2011, two potential treatments failed due to a lack of clear evidence that they were effective. Both were pharmaceuticals, which proceed through a different approval pathway than Marik's treatment, which does not involve any new drugs, but rather a combination of existing compounds. Marik will have to submit a research proposal for funding, with a review process that could take nine months. Results wouldn't be available for probably two years. But if the treatment is proven effective, it could save millions of lives and reshape medicine's understanding of how the body responds to inflammation. Will a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of Marik's treatment begin before 2019? This question will resolve as positive if a clinical trial registry such as clinicaltrials.gov or a credible news outlet reports that a trial treatment for sepsis involving corticosteroids and vitamins C and D is underway on or before December 31, 2018.","['Biology – Medicine – Clinical Trials', 'Biological Sciences – Medicine']"

""Tabby's Star"" displays severe, aperiodic dips in brightness that have so far defied conventional astrophysical explanations. Several explanations for this behavior have been put forward, ranging from a family of comets, to the indigestive aftereffects of the consumption of a planet by the star, to a swarm of artificial, orbiting “megastructures.” Very recently, KIC 8462852 has begun to dim again. Observations taken between May 18th and 19th 2017 show a 2% diminution of light from the star. A variety of telescopes are now being trained on the star, and will obtain data across the electromagnetic spectrum. Included in these follow-up efforts are campaigns that are specifically designed to look for evidence of artificially generated signals. The authors of the Astronomical Telegram describing the current dimming of the star write: We will continue our monitoring observations using Swift, LCO, and Fairborn, as well as our >spectroscopic observations as part of the Breakthrough Listen program using the APF-Levy >spectrometer at Lick Observatory (27 epochs obtained since Nov 21, 2015).

As of May 20, 2017, no consensus explanation of this star's behavior has emerged. It seems quite plausible, however, that multi-wavelength observations of the star while it is undergoing dimming may serve to sort out the mystery. We thus ask: Will a consensus emerge in 2017? We'll use the following criteria to specify consensus. Let N be the number of refereed published journal papers that: provide an explanation for the aperiodic dips seen in KIC 8462852, and are cited by at least one published paper, or two preprints, supporting their explanation with additional analysis and/or data, and are cited at least 5 times in total, and are not cited by a published, refereed paper refuting the given explanation.

996,Will Rentberry still be in operation with its current business model in 2019?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M478,"Industry ""disruption"" is a Silicon Valley buzzword. Companies like Netflix and Uber have upended (or just plain ended, in the case of movie rentals) entire industries. Such disruption rarely comes without pushback or controversy, however. Rentberry is an auction-style market for rental properties. Users submit bids of the price they're willing to pay for monthly rent and security deposit, and landlords decide which bid to accept. The company started in the San Francis area, where median rents for a one-bedroom apartment can top $3,600 per month. Although Rentberry claims that users pay around 4% less for apartments by using the app, an auction framework in a tight market tends toward driving prices up. Rentberry's business mode drawn some level of ire from various directions. Journalists covering the business have expressed distaste at the prospect of bidding wars and the demise of a semblance of affordable housing in hot urban markets. Beyond the gut reaction, however, Rentberry may be violating federal law. The Fair Housing Act is designed to prevent housing discrimination for protected classes. Landlords' choice of which bid to accept could result in allegations of discrimination. As happened with Uber and Airbnb, cities could act to bar or curtail Rentberry in their cities, cutting off access to the priciest and most lucrative pool of apartments. Other factors could also spell Rentberry's demise, such as a change in market conditions. The company makes money off of a $25 ""success fee,"" so a marked downturn in rental applications could hurt the revenue stream. Alternatively, runaway success could lead to Rentberry's buyout. With all of these possibilities in mind: Will Rentberry still be in operation with its current business model in 2019?

The consensus (as of 6/2017) on this currently open Metaculus question predicts that the first driverless cross-USA cargo truck run will occur in December 2018, a time frame better measured in months than in years. A recent report commissioned by Intel crisply predicts that autonomous driving (by both cars and trucks) will contribute $7 trillion to the economy, but it devolves to vague and euphemistic palliatives when the future prospects for truckers are discussed. For example, the report notes that autonomous vehicles — in displacing human drivers — will, ""create opportunities for transportation companies to utilize the `freed' time of drivers to evolve and enhance their role and impact to the organization."" The Trump administration was voted into office on the strength of support from a demographic that would experience proportionally large job losses if fully autonomous self-driving trucks become a reality. There may, therefore, be grass-roots pressure for legislation that keeps humans in the driver's seats. On the other hand, Trump has repeatedly spoken (and acted) in favor of deregulation generally. By January 2020, will US Federal regulations be implemented that restrict the operation of trucks without a human operator on board? For positive resolution, regulations (or laws) must be adopted at the federal (rather than state) level that significantly curtail, delay, or prohibit the adoption of autonomous trucking technologies, arguably for reasons that go beyond pure safety considerations. Evidence to this effect would include citing employment in the text or announcement of the regulations, restrictions that appear to have no viable basis in safety considerations, statements by unions or others to the effect that jobs or workers rights are a significant consideration, etc.","['Politics', 'Technology – Automotive', 'Industry – Transportation']"
998,Will Planet Nine be discovered by mid-2018?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M481,"In mid-January of 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- kicked the news media into high gear by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. Their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the planet count back up to nine. Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded nearly half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. During the past year, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been shown that it can account for curious orbital commensurabilities among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator. Based on the host of recent results, Metaculus now calculates a most probable current sky position for Planet Nine of RA=2h, Dec=0 deg. This area of the sky is optimally visible during late autumn for a planet at opposition. At the most probable current location, the planet's current distance would be r~950 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 22.4. A number of groups have engaged in the hunt, and there is something of an emerging consensus that if the planet is to be found, it'll be found sooner rather than later. As an example, Mike Brown gave sixteen months eight months ago. This third update to our original, now closed, Planet Nine question is thus in order: Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper, be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to July 1, 2018?

In 2014, NASA awarded commercial crew contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for their CST-100 and Dragon V2 capsule, respectively. At the time, former NASA administrator Charlie Bolden expected the US to end its reliance on Russian spacecraft by 2017. Although the schedule has been pushed back since then, the latest target flight dates call for unmanned flight tests for SpaceX and Boeing in November 2017 and June 2018, respectively, followed by crewed launches in May and August 2018. Crew assignments for the first flights could come as early as summer 2017, about a year before launch. Pressure to meet the deadline comes from NASA's move to not renew spaceflight contracts with Russia beyond the end of 2018.

The disease, which has dramatically impacted the state's citrus production, is carried by two species of psyllid, a flying sap-sucking insect. To protect the groves, the company Intellectual Ventures has developed a technology originally intended to control malaria-carrying mosquitoes - an array of lasers that zap the psyllids out of the air. Hear me out. The array is called the Photonic Fence, and uses cameras to identify only the target pest - psyllids in this case. Any psyllid within the laser's 30 m horizontal or 3 m vertical range is subject to a burst of laser light that heats the psyllid up just enough to kill it. According to the article: This summer in Florida, the Photonic Fence will initially be tested against psyllids released inside a screen house, an enclosure of fine mesh used to protect trees from pests. After that, and tests to prove it can avoid targeting bees, the device will be used to replace one wall of a screen house and get its first shot at wild psyllids.

1013,"By July 2018, will additional significant evidence emerge suggesting that our Sun experiences erg or larger flares on a time scale shorter than 1000 years?","['yes', 'no']",no,M519,"The Carrington Event, the strongest solar storm on record, was no joke. Shortly before Noon on September 1, 1859, amateur solar observers in England noticed an intense burst of light from a large sunspot group. Less than 20 hours later, a cloud of hot plasma ejected by the flare slammed into Earth's magnetosphere. Auroras were visible down to tropical latitudes, and telegraphs failed in spectacular fashion, reportedly delivering electric shocks to their operators. As discussed in a previous question, solar storms have the potential to impact power and communications systems, and storms at or above the Carrington level would have devastating effects. A 2013 assessment by Lloyd's estimates that if such an event were to occur today, damages to the US economy alone would range from 0.6 to 2.6 trillion dollars. Solar flares occur in association with magnetic field reconnection near the Sun's surface, and are most frequent during the active period of the solar cycle. The occurrence rate of solar storm energies follows a relatively well-defined power-law distribution, and the Carrington event was estimated to have had energy ~ 10 32 erg. The frequency of trans-Carrington storms, however, depends on how far the distribution extends, which is unknown. Some constraint comes from geological records. Evidence from an overabundance of radioactive 14C detected in tree rings suggests the Sun might have produced a small ""superflare"" in AD 775 and again in AD 993, although alternate explanations for the anomalies are also viable. Additional insight is gained by monitoring of the flares of nearby stars. Researchers using the LAMOST telescope have reported regular eruptions 10,000 times larger than the Carrington event on other stars. The team showed that these superflares are likely formed via the same mechanism as solar flares, and unexpectedly, they found ~10% of the superflaring stars have magnetic fields either comparable to or weaker than the Sun's, implicitly raising the possibility that our Sun could go amok with a massive flare. Superflaring stars generally have short rotation periods (which generate higher levels of magnetic activity), but stars with rotation as slow as the Sun can apparently also produce superflares. A study published in Nature showed a total of 187 superflares on 23 solar-type stars (5600-6000 K, rotational period > 10 d) having energies in the 10 32 − 10 36 erg range. A consideration of theoretical estimates in conjunction with the observations generated a published hypothesis that superflares of 10 34 erg occur once in ~800 yr on our present Sun. An analysis of Kepler photometry showed that superflares on solar-type stars (with rotational periods greater than 10 days) exhibit similar occurrence frequency distribution of those for solar flares. The analysis suggests, however, that all superflaring stars have starspot complexes substantially larger than those presently occurring during solar maxima. A reasonable summary of the current evidence suggests that the Sun can produce flares up to ~1000x the strength of the Carrington event, but such flares would require sunspot activity at levels substantially larger than those seen in the historical record. Given the stakes, it would be nice to have a better handle on the odds. By July 2018, will additional significant evidence emerge suggesting that our Sun experiences 10 34 erg or larger flares on a time scale shorter than 1000 years? Positive resolution requires a paper in the peer-reviewed literature by July 2018 in which a ""most likely"" or ""fiducial"" estimate of solar flares with energy 10 34 erg exceeds 1 per 1000 years. In addition, in order to add a specious bit of flair to the question, positive resolution will also occur in the unlikely event that a flare with energy exceeding 10 32 ergs occurs prior to July 2018.",['Physical Sciences – Astrophysics and Cosmology']

An open letter coordinated by the Future of Life Institute and signed by > 3000 AI/ML researchers and 17,000 others argues that If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.

In a nutshell, a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule (generally of the exotic deuterium-tritium variety), allowing the two nuclei to draw far closer than the normal covalent bond would allow. With proximity thus achieved, the probaility of deuterium-tritium fusion is greatly increased. After a fusion reaction occurs, the responsible muon is free to catalyze further events until it either decays (its rest frame half-life is two microseconds) or is removed from action by ""sticking"" to an alpha particle produced by the fusion. Economic viability of the process for creating energy would require that a single muon catalyze approximately 500 fusion events before it decays, a rate of efficiency that exceeds best efforts by at least a factor of two or three. Muon-catalyzed fusion was originally observed in laboratory experiments and described in this article by Luis Alvarez et al., and was studied in depth by John David Jackson, he of Jackson's Electrodynamics fame. Jackson's 1957 Physical Review article is a standard reference, and remarkably, more than a half-century later, he summarized the history of the field in this 2010 review. The prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion as an energy source seemed moderately bright during the 1980s and 1990s, following the elucidation and observation of molecular states of the deuterium-tritium-muon positive ion. The field has largely stalled in recent years, however, as workable schemes for either producing muons more cheaply, or improving their catalytic efficiency have failed to emerge. At the close of the 2010 article, Jackson seemed optimistic, writing, ""The effort for such a specialized field has been prodigious, especially in the last 30 years. On the applied side, ideas continue on how to increase the number of fusions per muon and design hybrid systems to get into the realm of net energy production."" Certainly, it is fair to state that development of effective muon-catalyzed fusion for energy production would be a global game changer.

As of the opening of this question, the VIX stands just below 11, so very roughly speaking, this means that the market ascribes a 30% chance that stocks will have changed in price by more than 3.2% by mid-October 2017. Typically, the value of the VIX lies between 12 and 20, but it regularly spikes during times of market turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, for example, the VIX briefly reached values above 80. So far during 2017, however, stock volatility has consistently tested near-record low levels, but jitters last month surrounding the situation on the Korean peninsula briefly caused the index to jump by more than 50%.

Were such a storm to strike today, however, the consequences to our technology-dependent society would be catastrophic. Such storms are the subject of several other questions, particularly this question regarding the frequency of such storms and this one regarding the construction of a satellite warning system. Two Harvard University professors, Manasvi Lingam and Abraham Loeb, recently estimate the losses at $10 trillion, with a years-long recovery. In contrast to that cost, which is approximately 50 times the cost of NASA's initial efforts to send humans to the moon. Given estimates upward of 1%/year of such a flare, this sort of prospective loss arguably calls for significant spending at risk mitigation. Beyond warnings or damage minimization, the above paper proposes a somewhat more radical astronomical protection plan. A loop of copper wire with a diameter similar to the Earth's, they say, powered by one terawatt, could create a sufficient magnetic field so as to deflect the energy of a solar storm enough to protect the planet's technology. Placed at the Lagrange point L1, the loop would cost about $100 billion to construct, Lingam and Loeb estimate. (As a fun side-beneit, they investigate how we might look for signs of such shields built by other civilizations out there.) Will anyone take this idea seriously? We'll ask the following: By 2021, will a chunk of more than $100,000 USD be spent in pursuit of this idea?

The interloping object, now officially known as 'Oumuamua (Hawaiian for ""messenger from the distant past"") was discovered by the PanSTARRS monitoring system on October 19th, 2017. It was quickly confirmed to have a strongly hyperbolic trajectory (with heliocentric velocity v~26 km/sec at infinity), and follow-up observations (see also, here) show that it has a rotation period of roughly seven hours, a reddish overall color, and a highly elongated overall shape. Assuming that 'Oumuamua has low reflectivity, its long axis is approximately 400m, and its mass is of order a billion kilograms. Curiously, no sign of coma has been detected, indicating that volatiles such as water ice are not exposed on its surface. These unusual properties have sparked speculation that `Oumuamua is a directed interstellar probe, and various SETI-related efforts are underway to examine it. The detection of `Oumuamua in the face of various observational biases suggests that such objects may pervade the Galaxy, with a number density estimated to be of order one per ten cubic astronomical units.

Whitford is concerned with Wisconsin's 2011 redistricting, which in the 2012 elections gave the Republicans 60% of the seats from 49% of the votes. A District Court decision ruled that the redistricting was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution on the grounds that it deprived everyone but Republicans of ""equal protection"". The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide it in mid-2018. The plaintiffs' case is based in part on various measures of gerrymandering, such as the so-called efficiency gap, and if the District Court's decision stands then it will likely make it easier for future gerrymandering cases to be brought on the basis of such measures. The question resolves negative if, by the end of 2018, the Supreme Court upholds the appeal by Gill et al, and positive if, by the end of 2018, the repeal is rejected. In other cases, it resolves ambiguous. Note on resolution conditions and title: In principle the Supreme Court could reject the appeal but deliberately not endorse any particular way of measuring gerrymandering, or could endorse some clear way of measuring gerrymandering that somehow doesn't reckon the Wisconsin redistricting to be a case of gerrymandering.

1058,Will Planet Nine be discovered by mid-2019?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M618,"Two years ago, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- kicked the news media into high gear by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. Their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the planet count back up to nine. Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded more than half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. During the past two years, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been shown that it can account for curious orbital commensurabilities among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator. If it does exist, the most likely sky location for Planet Nine is roughly RA=2h, Dec=0 deg, near aphelion (although the uncertainty on this direction is substantial). The favored area of the sky is optimally visible during late autumn for a planet at opposition. At the most probable current location, the planet's current distance would be r~950 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 22.4. A number of groups have engaged in the hunt, and there is something of an emerging consensus that if the planet exists to be found, it'll be found sooner rather than later. As an example, Mike Brown gave sixteen months fifteen months ago. This fourth update to our original, now closed, Planet Nine question is thus in order: Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper, be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to July 1, 2019?

The drumbeat of news that would have seemed outrageous just a year or so ago may have had a hand in lowering the bar for outre items in the venerable Gray Lady. In December of 2017, the New York Times gave front-page coverage to a bewildering investigative report of Glowing Auras and Black Money: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O. Program, co-authored by Times journalists Cooper, Blumenthal, and Kean. While taking a generally neutral stance, the report and associated coverage was nonetheless rather startling to readers steeped in the application of Occam's Razor. Indeed, the tone and content led some to notice a correlation with a general uptick in alien-themed astronomy papers and attendant media attention, including the ""Megastructures"" posited to be orbiting KIC 8462852, and the publicized attempts to monitor 'Oumuamua for artificial broadcasts.

This is still relatively small compared to ~$20B in 3rd quarter venture capital raises in 2017, but the proportion is rapidly rising. Coin offerings have three apparent contributors to their success. First, blockchain-related startups are a dynamic field, and ICOs for coins that provide utility in blockchain-based ventures are thus getting attention and funding. Second, even in companies whose business is not centrally blockchain-based, ICOs are providing a novel form of crowd-based participatory investment, requiring much less effort and paperwork than venture funding so that investment and participation is open to a community of people rather than a relatively small number of early-stage investors. Third, of course, the fact that cryptocurrencies have been rapidly rising of late has led to a great deal of speculative purchasing of coins based on the (quite unreliable) assumption that they will appreciate. Given that Metaculus is a crowd-based concern with a knowledgeable and (to some degree) crypto-savvy community, and already has an onsite token, it is a natural candidate for a coin offering. On the other hand, Metaculus is run by careful and risk-averse founders who are intimately in touch with the extraordinary unpredictability and volaility of the cryptocurrency field. And there is a good deal of regulatory uncertainty surrounding ICOs in the US and elsewhere... So what do you think: Will there be a Metaculus ICO in 2018?

Another indicator that precedes recessions by 1-1.5 years is the spread on 10 and 2 year Treasury bonds. This indicator also suggests we are at least 2 years out from a recession. Lastly, the FED publishes an explicit recession probability graph. It suggests we are not at the cusp of a recession, though indicators lag about three months, so this data is at best a confirmation of an ongoing decline.

But the most ambitious aspect of SpaceX's plan is the number of satellites they plan to launch: 4,425 satellites, with a potential for 7,518 satellites in orbital planes even closer to the ground. Only 1,500 satellites currently orbit Earth. On Feb. 22, 2018 SpaceX launched two test satellites, Tintin-1 and Tintin 2, which appear to share many of the characteristics of the satellites that the plan would eventually deploy. But will Starlink actually happen? And when? A full system as described could cost tens of billions of dollars total, and it is unclear whether the financing is in place. And there are competitive efforts by the OneWeb satellite constellation, a major Samsung effort and others. We'll ask: By 2021, will at least ten Starlink satellites have been launched and be in orbit? This can include the Tintins, and is aimed at whether ""production level"" satellites are starting to be put aloft.","['Computing – Internet', 'Industry – Space', 'Series — SpaceX']"
1081,"Will this question, with its secret resolution criteria, resolve positive?","['yes', 'no']",no,M666,"Disclaimer: This question is a bit experimental, but might be quite interesting. One of the most interesting things you notice when predicting on Metaculus is that any arbitrary event a priori is less likely to happen than not and less likely to happen than most people think (this is why the Metaculus prediction tends to calibrate down). An event is defined here as something you would ask to happen, rather than not happen, for a positive resolution to a question. It would be interesting to determine a general value for the a priori probability of an event happening as defined above. This value could allow us to estimate the probability of events for which there is little evidence for or against. For example, the probability that God exists has been estimated to be 67%, yet the problem is that the a priori was taken to be 50%. There is no reason to assume this. The only way to determine an a priori probability for a question resolving positive would be to remove anything question specific from the question: to not tell people what the question is. This is what we are going to do. A question has been set for the resolution of this question, but it is known only to me and the Metaculus admin. Obviously, those who know the question should not predict on this question. It is asked: Will this question, with its secret resolution criteria, resolve positive? To wet your appetite I'm going to outline a few possible considerations one might take when answering this question. Of course, there are many others. One could sample from the Metaculus track record. 55/208=26.4% of questions resolved positive (at least according to my counting). Yet, Metaculus also has a technology heavy question stack and there is a separate effect to the general overestimation of probabilities, which is the general overestimation of technological progress in our time, that might be influencing this figure. Note that no category has been selected for this question, as it is not given in which category it is. It may, or may not, have anything to do with technology. It might even be in a completely new category. Also, only short-term questions have resolved. What would be the a priori for more long-term questions? I could have picked a question we already know the answer to, which would have been a very long-term question long ago, for resolution. Or I could not have. You just don't know. Also, this question will resolve in 2018 and in 2018 (up to now) we have had even more negative resolutions than usual.",['Metaculus Itself']
1082,"On May 1 will the ICO space still be growing in overall size, and stable in success likelihood?","['yes', 'no']",no,M667,"(note: experimental question) Cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs) have become increasingly popular in 2016 and 2017, growing by a factor of 100 during 2017 with about $3B raised in total in 2017's 4th quarter. This is still relatively small compared to ~$20B in 3rd quarter venture capital raises in 2017, but the proportion is rapidly rising. However, cryptocurrencies hit a bit of a wall in mid-December 2017 and have been declining or stable between then and late February. Along with participation, utility, and investment, it's clear that a significant component of coin purchasing is speculation that the coins will increase in value because...there is speculation that the coins will increase in value because... So one might imagine that in a flat or declining coin market ICOs are going to have a tough time. The question one would like to answer if one were contemplating an ICO would be something like: On May 1 will the ICO space still be growing in overall size, and stable in success likelihood? (Here, ""success likelihood"" is something like expectation value of capital raised for a fixed quality of project.) The attentive Metaculus user will note that this question is far less specific and well-posed than usual. This is by intent. The question will be resolved in the following manner. The question will remain open until its resolution time. Then: If at the resolution time the community prediction probability is  90%, the question will resolve negatively or positively, respectively. Otherwise, it will be resolved by the personal, unquestioned discretion of the question's author. The intent (along with crypto-insight) is to experiment with a new idea about consensus question resolution, in which a question might close (differently from this one), but remain open for predictions about the resolution. This might either be neat, or perhaps create in infinite unstable meta-regress; we'll see and experiment.","['Finance — Cryptocurrencies', 'Computing – Blockchain', 'Metaculus Itself']"

And unless President Trump leaves office early or decides not to run again in 2020, we’ll have a Boomer on the ticket again in two years. Here’s the list of Boomers: 1992: Bill Clinton (D) 1996: Bill Clinton (D) 2000: Al Gore (D) and George W. Bush (R) 2004: George W.

And a recent win in a special election in Pennsylvania--in a district won convincingly by Trump in 2016--suggests that they have a shot at reclaiming the House. If they do succeed, an interesting scenario comes into play. Namely, there will be pressure on elected Democrats to take the fight to Trump and impeach him. Some Democratic strategists think this is a good idea. Others say it would be foolish. Per Politico: Polls on the question show as many as three-quarters of Democrats already back impeachment, and one deep-pocketed ally, California megadonor Tom Steyer, has been mounting an expensive pressure campaign across the country to build support for Trump's impeachment. Democratic hostility toward the Republican president seems to intensify daily. But lawmakers who recall the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton are wary of sparking a political backlash for appearing too eager to remove a president without buy-in from independents and even some Republicans. We're not here to debate the wisdom (or lack thereof) of such a strategy. We just want to know: do you think they'd follow through and do it?

That averages to approximately 2 a season. The last one was pitched by Sean Manaea of the Oakland A's on April 21, 2018. Statistically speaking, we should expect another no hitter by the end of the 2018 season. But perfect games are a whole different animal. To qualify for this honor, a team must put away every single batter through nine innings. No walks, men on base due to errors or hit batsmen allowed. To date, the sport has witnesses only a vanishingly small number of perfect games. As MLB.com colorfully explains: There have been just 23 such outings among the hundreds of thousands of big league games played since Rutherford B. Hayes was in the White House. That said, there have been 6 perfect games since 2009, with 3 of them coming in 2012 alone! And there's plenty of awesome pitching talent playing in 2018, including Clayton Kershaw, Corey Kluber, and Max Scherzer. Furthermore, a 538 analysis suggests that baseball's becoming a more pitcher-friendly game. The fans might not love a slower pace, but this trend should increase our chances of seeing a perfect game soon. 538 explains: The average delay between pitches has jumped a full second. It’s all part of a decadelong trend toward more sluggish play, and there’s an alarming reason baseball’s pace problem is likely to get even worse going forward: Slowing down helps pitchers throw faster.

A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes engineered gene drives tractable: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being ""driven,"" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one ""wild"" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited. This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival. Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. Valentino Gantz et. al. have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another study published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated engineering mice (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease. With Malaria afflicting hundreds of millions of people per year, advances in gene drive research have insitgated public conversation about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives is being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems. By January 1st, 2020, will a credible reports indicate that a formal submission has been made to a regulatory body proposing to test a malaria-combatting gene drive in a wild population? For positive resolution, the drive need not targeted for the US or home country of the researchers (indeed this is unlikely), but must be done under the purview of some regulatory body so that in principle parameters and details of the drive are provided and (potentially) approved by some authority. The drive itself need not be initiated to count. The wild population can be isolated (say on an island or even in an enclosure) to control spreading but should aim to replicate natural reproduction etc., and cannot be a laboratory setting.",['Biology']

And, there are lots of very useful things they can now do. But of course, drones can also be a bit creepy, and there is a dark side. For instance, this miltary-educated blogger discusses havoc he could wreak with technology he could buy at Walmart or the Apple Store: I’m holding a drone that can fly thousands of feet in air in less than 30 seconds, getting it to an altitude where no one could see it. My drone could be up in the air, ready to strike a target before you even had time to blink... It is not meant to take nice photos of my vacation. It is meant to strike.

Per ABC News, Trump said: It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. Very importantly I'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces, that is a big statement... We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the space force, separate but equal, it is going to be something. Bloomberg's editorial board seemed open to the idea, writing: plenty of critics have argued — persuasively — that the current arrangement is impeding much-needed change and innovation. Could Trump’s Space Force, or something like it, do better? Several studies, dating back to 2001, suggest that it could. If organized with care and forethought, such a force could clarify accountability, accelerate decision-making, rationalize the procurement process, improve recruitment, and ease pressure on the broader Air Force, which is heavily burdened with more traditional responsibilities. Not everyone agrees. Writing for Slate, Fred Kaplan argues: The special thing about satellites and the organizations that control or operate them (Air Force Space Command, the NRO, and other smaller outfits) is that they are, by nature, subordinate to other branches of the armed forces—to wars that are fought not in outer space but on Earth or in the atmosphere. Space assets service air, naval, and ground forces by providing them with intelligence, communications, and guidance for missiles and smart bombs. Placing these vital assets under the command of a four-star general in a separate service—and imbuing its officers and enlisted personnel with the élan of an elite force that doesn’t answer to the other services of the armed forces and that, in fact, competes with them for resources—would run counter to the nation’s needs. In any event, for the Space Force to materialize, Congress would have to authorize and fund it. Will legislators do so prior to the 2020 presidential election?

The renegade billionaire hopes to blaze a path to the future. As Wait But Why's Tim Urban explained in an epic blog post nearly 3 years ago--based on extensive interviews with Musk: The overarching mission wasn’t to build the biggest car company in the world. It was to solve a bunch of long-standing EV shortcomings and build such an insanely great car that it could change everyone’s perception of what an EV could be and force the world’s big car companies to have to develop their own line of great EVs. Their end goal, and the company’s official mission, was “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” In other words, EVs are gonna happen, but we’re gonna make them happen a lot sooner. Sooner, in this case, is important, because it means carbon emissions decrease earlier and the long term effects of them are much less damaging. Since that time, a lot has happened in the world of EVs. Tesla built and launched its Gigafactory to create next gen batteries at scale. Many conventional companies have joined Tesla to ramp up production of EVs, with Forbes reporting that ""The electrification of the transport system is set to accelerate in the late 2020s... Electric vehicle sales will surge thanks to tumbling battery costs and increasing scale in manufacturing."" Tesla's Model 3 has gotten record distance on a single charge, despite problems. On the other hand, perhaps surprisingly, Tesla is struggling to be a profitable company. As the New York Times reported on May 1, Tesla is still burning cash to stay afloat. But the company's billionaire leader insists that Tesla will be profitable as soon as Q3 of 2018. Per Techcrunch: On Tesla’s last call to discuss the company’s quarterly results with Wall Street analysts, Musk said that the company would begin generating “positive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis,” and said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the company would be GAAP profitable.

With some regularity, the sun ""flares."" Per NASA: A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation coming from the release of magnetic energy associated with sunspots. Flares are our solar system’s largest explosive events. They are seen as bright areas on the sun and they can last from minutes to hours. As you might expect, not all flares are created equal. Scientists clasify them according to intensity. Per convention, the smallest flare class is ""A""; then we have ""B"" and ""C""; for some reason, we skip to ""M""; and, lastly, we finish with the fearsome ""X"", which, among other things, can knock out radio communications around the world. X-Class flares are the rarest. And they can be dangerous to Earthlings and our technology, especially if the flare's business end points right at us. Here's a description of a mega flare (technically, an X28 on the scale) that blasted forth from the sun in November, 2003: The effects on Earth were many: Radio blackouts disrupted communications. Solar protons penetrated Earth's upper atmosphere, exposing astronauts and some air travelers to radiation doses equal to a medical chest X-ray. Auroras appeared all over the world--in Florida, Texas, Australia and many other places where they are seldom seen. X-Class flares are uncommon, but not that uncommon. Last September, for instance, saw a spate of them. What do you think? Will the sun blast off another X-Class flare before October 1, 2018?

1138,Will the IBM's Summit remain the top dog in supercomputing power?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M1050,"In early June, IBM together with the Department of Energy launched Summit, the world's newest biggest supercomputer. It processes at a mind-numbing 200,000 trillion calculations per second. Per TechCrunch: Summit... features 4,608 compute servers with two 22-core IBM Power9 chips and six Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs each. In total, the system also features over 10 petabytes of memory. For now, Summit stands at the top (so to speak) of the TOP500 list. But international competition in the supercomputer realm is fierce. As GCN reported last year: China’s dominance on the recent [top supercomputer] lists indicates it is investing heavily in high-performance computing as supercomputers become a vital tool for simulating everything from nuclear explosions to medicine. Meanwhile, in early 2018, the EU announced it was joining the party. Engadget reported: Buying and developing supercomputing technology is crazy expensive, with exascale machines expected to cost up to a half billion dollars. To buy and develop them, Europe will spend $486 million itself, with the balance of the $1.2 billion coming from member states. It plans to first acquire machines that can compete with current top supercomputers, then develop its own exascale machines by 2023. It seems unlikely that another country (e.g. China) will break Summit's record in the next few months. But it also seems inevitable that Summit will eventually be dethroned. Will Summit continue to hold the top spot on the upcoming November Top500 list? (the official list comparing the world's supercomputers)",['Computing']

It is possible, though, that the negative reaction he has received around his Helsinki meeting is different in kind, and will unsettle some of his staunchest supporters. As of this moment (8:30pm PT on July 16, 2018) Trump's approval rating on the fivethirtyeight.com aggregated Approval Rating Page is 42.1%. It takes on the order of several days for new incoming polls to be received and aggregated to the point where they begin to affect the rolling aggregate. So we will determine the answer based on a reading two weeks from now.

This means that he will (a) not be removed beforehand, (b) actually run for a second term, and (c) legally defeat other presidential nominees. Resolution is based on consensus major-media declaration that enough states have been called for or against Trump to give more than 50% of the total electors to one candidate. It does not imply that Trump will necessarily serve a second term, even if elected, and in particular does not account for events that may occur between election night and swearing in. Resolution is ambiguous if a major media call has not been made as of one week after the election; in this case one or more alternative questions will be launched. If Trump dies or is removed from office by any means prior to the election, question resolves negative, and will retroactively close one week prior to the takeover of the Presidential office by Pence or another party. If Trump publicly declares that he will not seek re-election, question resolves negative on the date when it becomes essentially impossible for him to become the Republican nominee, with a retroactive closing date 1 day prior to the public declaration.","['Politics – US', 'Series – Future Perfect 2020', 'Elections – U.S. – President']"
1142,Will a scientific mission to the outer solar system be assigned to the Falcon Heavy within the next 5 years?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M1139,"NASA, sometimes in cooperation with other countries, launches missions to space to study planets, stars and other celestial bodies. In order to do this, scientists and engineers have to account for factors, such as money and weight. To make a decent mission and to gather as much data as possible, a probe that NASA could send has to carry with it many scientific instruments. The more instruments there are, the heavier the probe is (and more expensive). The heavier the probe is, the more powerful the rocket to send it has to be. The more powerful the rocket is, the more expensive the mission is. Money and weight are the two main factors to make a mission to space. These days, NASA's budget is more and more reduced. It was 0.47% of the federal budget in 2017 whereas it could reach 4.41% during the Apollo era. Only a few missions can be made, and most of them concern the study of Earth, stars, or the internal solar system. Even though some missions plan to study Jupiter, its moons, and sometimes Saturn, not a single mission, not even as a project, is planified to study space beyond the orbit of Saturn at the moment. The last and only mission that studied Uranus and Neptune was Voyager 2 and New Horizons studied Pluto for a few hours after a 9 years journey through space. But earlier this year, the Falcon Heavy was launched for the first time. SpaceX's new heavy launcher, and current most powerful rocket is capable of launching 63,800 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 3,500 kg to Pluto, for a cost of 150M $, whereas the Delta IV heavy, the previous most powerful rocket, could only launch 28 790 kg to LEO for a cost of 400M $. The price of the kg in space is almost 6 times lower for the Falcon Heavy than the Delta IV Heavy (2351 $/KG → FH -- 13893 $/KG → D4H). Therefore, the Falcon Heavy offers to NASA and other agencies the possibility to multiply its capacities of studying space and for a lower cost. Will a scientific mission to the outer solar system be assigned to the Falcon Heavy within the next 5 years? resolves positive if by end of July 2023, a credible media or other announcement indicates that a contract has been signed with SpaceX as one party, for the purpose of a scientific payload being launched on a Falcon Heavy rocket.

By following these breadcrumbs, which normies miss because they only follow the MSM (mainstream media), you can discover a set of alarming facts about the world. Donald Trump is working with George Mueller in order to take down Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and other liberals who are part of an international child sex trafficking ring. The Deep State is going after Donald Trump, trying to take down his presidency, but he won’t let this coup occur. Their rallying cry is “The storm is coming” a reference to Trump's cryptic claim.

Think the Da Vinci Code meets your paranoid uncle that lives in his prepper shelter. This movement began on internet discussion boards and spread like wildfire to popular sites like Youtube and Reddit. Ultimately it made its way into the real world at the Trump Rally on July 31, 2018 in Tampa, FL. You can readily see that QAnon supporters were out in full force (you can tell by their fly gear). Now that you know something about QAnon, let’s move on to the question. This NBC news article posits that Tracy Diaz, Christina Urso, and Coleman Rogers are responsible for the spreading of QAnon. In November 2017, a small-time YouTube video creator (Tracy Diaz) and two moderators of the 4chan website (Christina Urso and Coleman Rogers), one of the most extreme message boards on the internet, banded together and plucked out of obscurity an anonymous and cryptic post from the many conspiracy theories that populated the website's message board. From: How three conspiracy theorists took 'Q' and sparked Qanon (names added) Who is Coleman Rogers and why would anyone think that he is part of QAnon? A review of Rogers’ Facebook page shows he had been active in internet politics and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, self-identifying as part of the “meme war” — the creation and dissemination of images and internet-style commentary that internet agitators on the chans and Reddit credit with Trump’s win. Rogers often posted memes about “liberal tears” as well as the ludicrous claims that Democrats murdered children and worshipped Satan — details similar to those that would eventually form the Qanon theory. (ibid) So he has a history of spreading absurd lies on the interwebs. What else? Within a month (of being kicked off Reddit), Rogers, 31, and his wife, Christina Urso, 29, had launched the Patriots’ Soapbox, a round-the-clock livestreamed YouTube channel for Qanon study and discussion. The channel is, in effect, a broadcast of a Discord chatroom with constant audio commentary from a rotating cast of volunteers and moderators with sporadic appearances by Rogers and Urso. In April, Urso registered Patriots’ Soapbox LLC in Virginia. Rogers and Urso use their channel to call for donations that are accepted through PayPal, cryptocurrencies or mail.”( parenthetical added ibid) Perhaps they are merely profiting off of this cultural phenomenon. However, some believe that Rogers really is Q. Some YouTube channels, like one named Unirock, are mostly dedicated to poring over Patriots’ Soapbox livestreams and dissecting purported slip-ups. One archived livestream appears to show Rogers logging into the 8chan account of “Q.”The Patriots’ Soapbox feed quickly cuts out after the login attempt. “Sorry, leg cramp,” Rogers says, before the feed reappears seconds later. (ibid) Resolution criteria: Will Coleman Rogers be revealed as Q by September 16th? Maybe we’ll get lucky and Anonymous will do the dirty work for us and unmask the real Q. Otherwise this could be difficult to resolve. If Rogers has been perpetuating the myth of Q in order to make money then he wouldn't be terribly likely to be forthright about it. Given that difficulty, this question will use consensus forming to create its own answer on whether Rogers is indeed Q (individually, or as a member of a team). Note that the close date will follow the September 16th revelation deadline by two weeks so that we have sufficient time for the community to build a consensus and thus adjudicate. If the community prediction at the time of closing is > 90%, then the question resolves positive. If the community prediction at the time of closing is < 10%, then the question resolves negative. If the community prediction at the time of closing is ≥ 10% and ≤ 90%, then the question author (Ben, the Arbiter of Truth) shall decide resolution. It is important to note that by asking the question concerning the identity of Q, we are missing the point. The funniest thing about those who try to discredit Q..

The hackers sent forged notification emails to Senate targets claiming the target’s Microsoft Exchange password had expired, and instructing them to change it.

As such, it isn't much different from the social media bots and astroturfing we already know will be attempting to influence the election process. More relevant for this question is the very real concern of voting booth security, which the state of Nevada, at least, has devoted $8M to improving. North Carolina has also developed a plan for systemic upgrades, and Florida is attempting to improve their process as well.. These efforts would be in addition to the $250M Senate Democrats are attempting to disburse over Republican objections. NBC News has reported that, at the federal level, no one is in charge of election security oversight: ""The President has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation state or other malicious actors,"" the White House said in a statement afterward. But current and former officials tell NBC News that 19 months into his presidency, there is no coherent Trump administration strategy to combat foreign election interference — and no single person or agency in charge. This is despite the fact that official state websites are eminently vulnerable. From FiveThirtyEight: ...the subpar preparation of state websites and election systems remains a concern for cybersecurity experts. According to Hursti, the potential vulnerabilities outlined by Appsecuri were basic. Using slang for relatively inexperienced hackers, he called them “‘script-kids’ vulnerabilities, which anyone can find.” Hursti said that no website “with anything meaningful” should have these kinds of vulnerabilities on its site in 2018. With all that in mind, the question: Will the 2018 US Midterm elections be hacked? Resolves positive if by Jan 15, 2019, the ODNI, other US agency (DOJ, FEC), or Congressional Committee, releases a report assessing affirmatively that hacking (as defined below problem) was part of the 2018 campaign of influence. For our purposes, ""hacked"" is understood to mean the unauthorized access of a site or system--distinct from but still compatible with mimicking the appearance of same--perpetrated by a malicious actor with the express intent to alter the outcome of any or all elections in the timeframe. For example, an official entering account information into a webpage designed to look legitimate, resulting in a compromised machine that precipitates an info dump, e.g. is not a hack, but the takeover or penetration of that same website would be. Alternatively, an intentional miscount of physical ballots would not be a hack, but a manipulation of a system to do the same would be.",['Elections – U.S.']
1161,Will an NFL player die during a game during the 2018-2019 season?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1372,"Are you ready for some football?! Awesome, now let’s talk about a fun topic... death. During the past 98 years, Chuck Hughes is the only NFL player to die on the field during a game. In 1971, Chuck was playing for the Detroit Lions when he had a heart attack on the field. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. It turns out that he had an undiagnosed heart condition (advanced arteriosclerosis) which doctors failed to diagnose (he had been admitted previously complaining about chest pains). His widow filed a lawsuit that was resolved in 1974. For the purposes of this question, we are only considering imminent death that results from an injury sustained on the field. This distinction may seem inconsequential, but if we don’t employ such a clear distinction, then many more deaths could be attributed to playing NFL football. Arguably, concussions received on the field lead to an early demise by contributing to CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. Consider the recent NFL concussion settlement which includes thousands of submitted claims. This is why, for our purposes, we want to consider only imminent death from an injury sustained on the field and not the long term consequences of playing football. To recapitulate, we are interested in whether or not an NFL player dies during a game during the 2018-2019 season. The regular season began on Thursday, September 6. The season ends upon crowning a victor at Super Bowl LII on February 3, 2019. Question is resolved as positive if a credible news agency reports that an NFL player dies during a game by February 3, 2019 at 11:59 PM (Eastern Standard Time).",['Sports']

1166,Will we see evidence that Piracetam is a more effective Alzheimer's treatment than Memantine by 2021?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1386,"This is the third in a three-part series of questions suggested by the Qualia Research Institute, with particular thanks to Andrés Gómez Emilsson, whom you can find blogging at the always interesting QualiaComputing.com   There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and to the extent that current medications can treat it, their effects on cognitive decline are more akin to hurdles than roadblocks. One of the most common treatments for Alzheimer’s is Memantine, which “is prescribed to improve memory, attention, reason, language and the ability to perform simple tasks.” It is considered to have a “small” positive effect on moderate to severe AD cases, and no significant improvement for patients in early stages of the disease. Piracetam is one of the most widely used types of Nootropic, a class of substance generally characterized by its purported effects on cognition and mood. In the US, it is recreationally used in a manner similar to a stimulant such as Adderall, with reported effects ranging from improved verbosity to higher productivity to a decrease in depressive symptoms. None of these, nor any other use of Piracetam is approved by the FDA, and research of the drug on diagnosed cases of AD or dementia have been discouragingly inconclusive at best and unilaterally damning at worst. On the other hand, a lot of guys on Reddit think it makes them talk more. (A minority of users of Piracetam report reductions in mood, and this question is not in any way meant as an endorsement of this or any other nootropic.) By 2021, will a published paper or pre-print conclude that Piracetam (or other racetams such as Phenylpiracetam) is more effective than Memantine at slowing cognitive decline, restoring function, or significantly alleviating symptoms of the disease?

1169,Will Jordan Peterson endorse Maxime Bernier as Canada's next Prime Minister ahead of the 2019 Canadian federal election?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1412,"Canada is heading into a federal election in the fall of 2019. Recently, there has been a fracture in the Conservative Party of Canada: the libertarian-leaning MP from Quebec, Maxime Bernier, left the party over complaints that it is ""morally and intellectually corrupt"" and beholden to special interest groups whom they serve at the public's expense. Bernier's acrimonious departure came after the Conservative Party caucus — mostly notably leader Andrew Scheer, who beat Bernier by two percentage points during a 2017 leadership race — distanced themselves from him in the wake of blowback to his comments addressing what he called the ruling Liberal party's policies of ""extreme diversity"". Bernier has declared his intentions to form his own federal political party and field candidates in all 338 of Canada's federal ridings. He enjoys considerable grassroots support. A poll of a thousand Canadians shortly after he announced his intention to form a party found 13% of Canadians intended to cast their vote for its candidates. While this is an impressive start, it's clear that Bernier has an uphill battle ahead of him in order to ascend to the Prime Ministership, or even to the Leader of the Official Opposition, a position currently occupied by his formal rival Scheer. One big boost to Bernier's candidacy would be an endorsement from Canadian intellectual Jordan Peterson, who is arguably the most well-known and popular intellectual in the Western world today. His work — which is often articulated in bombastic popular lectures — covers topics such as free speech, identity, anti-totalitarianism, personality, performance, and religion, among many others. Peterson's reach is considerable: his lectures have been viewed nearly 70 million times on YouTube, and his new book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over half a million copies. Peterson and Bernier have crossed paths before. Bernier cited a meeting with Jordan Peterson has having changed his mind on endorsing Bill C-16, which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include the terms ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"". He met Peterson again and was photographed with him this past April at an event in Montreal, where he says the two of them spoke on the topic of freedom of speech. Peterson considers himself to be a ""classical liberal"", while Maxime resists political labelling but has suggested he himself might reasonably be called a freedom-loving fiscal conservative, or a ""reasonable libertarian"". Both share a dislike for the policies and perspectives of the current Prime Minster, Justin Trudeau, and his Liberal Party. While there is perhaps not much political space between Bernier and Peterson, its not clear that Peterson is in the business of offering political endorsements. He seems not to have made any publicly during the 2015 Canadian federal election. He did say, when asked, that he would be open to endorsing candidate Tanya Granic Allen during the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race earlier this year, but no such endorsement ever came. That said, he clearly has an interest in politics, and even considered running in the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race after the previous leader Patrick Brown resigned amidst allegations of sexual misconduct. Peterson's ideas have already had a large impact on Canadian politics at the federal and provincial level. It no doubt informed the pushback among federal Conservatives on Bill C-16, and has fueled the concerns of both federal and provincial conservatives regarding the challenges to freedom of speech on the country's university campuses. Jordan Peterson will be considered to have ""endorsed"" Maxime Bernier if he declares in a public statement or utterance that he endorses him to be Canada's next Prime Minister. Nothing short of an unequivocal endorsement — such as Peterson mentioning Bernier or his policies favourably in the media — will suffice.","['Politics', 'Elections — Canada']"

Nope, it’s contemporary science. I confess that I only have a dubious conception of superconductors. Despite my sophomoric understanding, even I can see the monumental implications of such a technology. In “Evidence for Superconductivity at Ambient Temperature and Pressure in Nanostructures” authors Dev Kumar Thapa and Anshu Pandey from the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit at the Indian Institute of Science make a stunning claim. Despite being a low temperature phenomenon till date, superconductivity has found numerous applications in diverse fields of medicine, science and engineering. The great scientific interest in the phenomenon as well as its practical utility has motivated extensive efforts to discover and understand new superconductors. We report the observation of superconductivity at ambient temperature and pressure conditions in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded into a gold matrix. Specifically, we observe that upon cooling below 236K at ambient pressures, the resistance of sample films drops below 0-4 Ohm, being limited by instrument sensitivity. Further, below the transition temperature, samples become strongly diamagnetic, with volume susceptibilities as low as -0.056. We further describe methods to tune the transition to temperatures higher than room temperature. (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1807/1807.…) This article evoked caution and incredulity from the scientific community. The plot thickens. Brian Skinner, an MIT researcher, ran a analysis of the data in Thapa’s and Pandey’s article. The graph plots a material’s magnetic susceptibility - the degree at which the material becomes magnetized after a magnetic field is applied - at a given temperature. The jump up in magnetic susceptibility is when the material is approaching its critical temperature to become superconductive. Skinner noticed that the pattern of green and blue data plots are pretty much exact copies of each other only shifted down by a constant amount. He consulted other physicists at MIT and elsewhere to see if they had encountered anything like it in their experiments. But all of them were very baffled by it and could think of no obvious explanation for it. This reminded many scientists of the Schon scandal, including Pratap Raychaudhuri, a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India. So he takes to Facebook to say as much, and then things get downright scandalous. Raychaudhuri gets an email from T. V. Ramakrishnan, a well known theoretical condensed matter physicist, telling him not to publicly rebuke Thapa and Pandley. Raychaudhuri fires off a response to Ramakrishnan, and then he gets a phone call from Ramakrishnan saying that he never sent that email.

There is unambiguous evidence that climate change, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (as well as other greenhouse gases), is responsible for the relentless upward trend. Nonetheless, stochastic variations do lend a short-term veneer of unpredictability to near-term measurements. A recently closed Metaculus question that asked whether 2018 will break the global heat record was quite popular -- 458 predictions were registered, with the community of predictors ascribing a median 33% chance of going over the top.

1179,Does Atiyah have an actual proof of the Riemann hypothesis?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1456,"The eminent mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah will be giving a talk on Monday 2018-09-24 at the Heidelberg Laureates' Forum in which, so it is claimed, he will be presenting a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. Here's an announcement from the HLF twitter account, and an article in New Scientist magazine. The Riemann hypothesis is arguably the most important open problem in mathematics. Somewhere around a century ago, David Hilbert is said to have remarked that if he were to fall asleep for a thousand years, his first question on waking would be ""Has anyone proved the Riemann hypothesis?"". It is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's millennium problems, with a $1M reward available for its solution. Michael Atiyah is a very eminent mathematician indeed. He was awarded the Fields medal in 1966 and the Abel prize in 2004. He has been President of the Royal Society and Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He is in these respects exactly the sort of person who should be solving famous open problems. On the other hand, he is 89 years old, when mathematicians are generally well past their prime. A couple of years ago he published a paper claiming to prove another long-standing conjecture, namely that the 6-dimensional sphere admits no complex structure, and it seems to be generally felt that this paper does not come close to doing what it claims to do. Some mathematicians are quite outspoken in suggesting that Atiyah's recent history makes it unlikely that he really has a proof of the Riemann hypothesis. So we ask: Does Atiyah have an actual proof of the Riemann hypothesis? Or at least something near enough to one that it remains only to patch up a few small holes? to keep this question short term, we'll look at the reaction to Atiyah's lecture, with resolution as follows: Two weeks after the lecture, we will collect all public statement by Fields-prize-winning mathematicians that express a firm opinion that either (a) Atiyah may well have proved the Riemann hypothesis, or (b) Atiyah's proof is fairly clearly flawed. The question will resolve positive if all firm statement are of type (a), negative if they are of type (b), and ambiguous if they are mixed or there are no such statement.",['Mathematics – Pure Mathematics']

1181,Will there be another mass shooting in the U.S. (at least 20 casualties) by end of the year?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M1479,"How many people must be killed or injured in order for an event to constitute a ‘mass shooting’? Congress defines the term ‘mass killings’ as, “the term ‘mass killings’ means 3 or more killings in a single incident.” Some balk at this definition, contending that the threshold is too low. You need more than three victims in order for such a designation to make sense. Note that we immediately moved from mass killings to mass shootings, because gun violence is just that common in America. Perhaps with more data on gun violence in American society we could have a more reasonable definition. This raises another contentious issue in this debate, how do we track the number of shootings? Who is the authority on this data? You might think that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention should have a significant role in monitoring gun violence since many people consider this a public health issue. After all, their motto is “CDC 24/7. Saving lives. Protecting people.” Lest ye forget, this is America: In 1996, the Republican-majority Congress threatened to strip funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unless it stopped funding research into firearm injuries and deaths. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of promoting gun control. As a result, the CDC stopped funding gun-control research — which had a chilling effect far beyond the agency, drying up money for almost all public health studies of the issue nationwide. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2…) This is known as the Dickey Amendment and it too has become a contentious issue in the national debate about gun control. Fortunately, we can table this issue and proceed with our forecasting. For the purposes of this question we will consider mass shootings with 20 casualties. By casualty we are referring to an individual that is killed or injured during the shooting (and yes, this includes the shooter). This makes for a more interesting question. Note that the recent Jacksonville shooting would not meet the threshold set forth here. Mass shootings, as defined earlier, have become a commonplace event in this American life. The FBI provides reliable data about ‘active shooters’. According to the FBI, the US endured 20 mass killings in 2016 and 2017. Mass shooting involving more than 20 casualties are rarer. Thus far, we have only had one such event in 2018. The Stoneman Douglas High School shooting claimed 17 lives and included 17 injuries. In 2017, we had two such events. The Las Vegas Massacre in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 in which 58 people were killed and 289 wounded. Also, the Sutherland Springs church shooting on November 5, 2017 in which 27 people were killed (including the shooter and an unborn child) and 20 wounded. Despite the previously mentioned controversy concerning obtaining reliable data about gun violence once we increase the threshold to include 20 casualties it becomes readily apparent how we will resolve our question. A mass shooting with 20 or more casualties will be all over every media site in the hours following such a horrific event. (Question resolves as affirmative if a credible news agency reports that a mass shooting, with 20 casualties) occurred in the United States of America. Depressingly, we all know that another mass shooting will occur, it is simply a matter of when. Closes and resolves retroactively to one day prior to the event should one occur.",['Social issues – Crime and Violence']

1183,Will Donald Trump appoint at least one more Justice to the Supreme Court before the end of his presidency?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M1498,"So far, Trump appointed two Justices to the SCOTUS - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -, and there are no vacancies. However, there is a good chance that Republicans will maintain control of the Senate until 2020, and there might be a vacancy before then. For example, justice Thomas might decide to retire when he can be pretty sure that he will be replaced by a conservative. At 70, he is not particularly old for the court, but he might not want to risk having to wait for another Republican President, in case a Democrat wins in 2020. Another possibility would be the death of one of the justices. Moreover, Trump might be reelected in 2020, and Republicans might control the Senate for at least some time during his second term. So, it is asked: Will Donald Trump appoint at least one more Justice to the Supreme Court before the end of his presidency? Resolution is positive if the following two conditions obtain: Donald Trump sends the nomination of at least one new Supreme Court Justice to the Senate, the Senate approves the nomination, and the new Justice is sworn in. Donald Trump has been the President of the United States at all times from the moment this question opens to the moment he sends the nomination of Condition 1. For the purposes of Condition 2., any situation in which Trump is temporarily not exercising his office (e.g., Cheney was Acting President when Bush had surgery) will not preclude a positive resolution, as long as he continues to be the President in the technical constitutional sense. Resolution is negative if a positive resolution is no longer constitutionally possible (in practice, at most a year after the end of Trump's presidency, this will have resolved).",['Politics – US']

This was not unexpected as this particular gyro had been exhibiting end-of-life behavior for the past year. Two similar gyros have already failed. Back in 2009 six new gyroscopes were installed, and the remaining three are enhanced. An Anomaly Review Board is currently investigating the issue. From NASA: If the outcome indicates that the gyro is not usable, Hubble will resume science operations in an already defined “reduced-gyro” mode that uses only one gyro. While reduced-gyro mode offers less sky coverage at any particular time, there is relatively limited impact on the overall scientific capabilities. As of question creation, the Hubble Telescope is still in Safe Mode. NASA seems confident that it will exit Safe Mode and resume scientific operations soon. Will the Hubble Telescope resume operations in its three-gyro configuration before the end of 2018? If the Hubble Telescope resumes three-gyro configuration for any duration of time and thereafter ceases that configuration—to enter reduced-gyro mode or for any other reason—the question still resolves positive.

After 20 years, both signatories started to allege the other was violating the treaty. Russia supposedly by developing the SSC-8 cruise missile, and the US by opening bases in Rumania and Poland. The US' increased use of armed drones is also claimed to be in violation of the treaty.

Here’s how it works: CREATE A COASTLINE The system consists of a 600-meter-long floater that sits at the surface of the water and a tapered 3-meter-deep skirt attached below. The floater provides buoyancy to the system and prevents plastic from flowing over it, while the skirt stops debris from escaping underneath. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OCEANIC FORCES Both the plastic and system are being carried by the current. However, wind and waves propel only the system, as the floater sits just above the water surface, while the plastic is primarily just beneath it. The system thus moves faster than the plastic, allowing the plastic to be captured. CONCENTRATE THE PLASTIC AND TAKE IT OUT Natural forces move the system faster than the plastic which allows the plastic to be captured in the center of the system. The Ocean Cleanup Technology Slat's system is currently en route to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch where it will face the most rigorous test thus far. The next milestone for The Ocean Cleanup is to have 60 systems up and running by 2021. Positive resolution is if they fail to meet their goal.

The latter is particularly interesting since Merkel herself always insisted on the Chancellor also holding the office of respective party chairman, a practise she criticised her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, for abandoning in light of rising criticism regarding his reform plans. Her current prospective successors as chairmen of the CDU are: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the unofficial favourite, Friedrich Merz, who had left politics a decade ago, and Jens Spahn, the current Minister of Health. There are a few possibilities open right now; Merkel may choose to leave office prematurely for a successor to gain valuable experience as a chancellor. But it is doubtful if the junior partner in the coalition, the SPD, would support such a move, preferring new elections instead. Similarly the new chairman may obstruct Merkel in parliament to raise their profile for the next federal elections, possibly to the extent of triggering premature federal elections. Thus we ask: Will there be Federal Elections held in Germany prior to the earliest date slated for the next elections?

In November 2017, he released a statement corroborating the claims, saying that ""these stories are true"" and that he would ""step back and take a long time to listen"".

Details: the recording has to be intentionally released by C.K. or his professional representation; the recording has to be accessible to 'laypeople' who don't work in the media industry; it has to be a recording of previously unreleased material; it does not necessarily have to cost money to view; the official release date in at least one jurisdiction has to be before January 1st 2021; and it can be in audio or video format, so a stand-up comedy album will also count as a ""special"" here. The criteria are intended to exclude ""showcases"" in which C.K. is one performer of many, documentaries or other formats featuring C.K. in which he performs a small amount of stand-up, re-releases of previous material, recordings in which C.K. opens for another comedian who is the main act, surreptitious recordings of live performances, and leaks or limited releases of specials before 2021 when the official release date is after 31st December 2020.","['Social issues', 'Entertainment']"
1199,Will a citizen of the People's Republic of China be declared a 2019 Nobel Prize winner?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1602,"The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the most populous country in the world, with 1.4 billion inhabitants. It is also the second-largest economy in the world by GDP. However, the number of people who have won Nobel Prizes and who were PRC citizens at the time they won their prize is very small: under the strictest definition, only three people meet these criteria. They were awarded prizes in 2010, 2012 and 2015. This question asks the following: When the winners of the 2019 Nobel Prizes are officially announced, will one of the them be a current citizen of the PRC? For the purposes of this question: In addition to the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences is also considered a ""Nobel Prize"" Both of the two Nobel Prizes in Literature that will be awarded in 2019 will be considered as a ""2019 Nobel Prize"", unless the organisation specifically names one of them as being a 2018 Nobel Prize A Chinese citizen being one of two or three people who share a Nobel Prize in 2019 will meet resolution criteria If an organisation of more than three people wins a Nobel Prize – as occurred for the Peace Prizes in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017 – it will not meet the criteria for positive resolution, even if the organisation is based in China and staffed entirely by Chinese citizens In the unlikely event that a new Prize category is awarded in 2019, and that this Prize is officially listed as a Prize on the Nobel Prize website, this Prize will also count as a ""Nobel Prize"", even if, as for Economic Sciences, the Prize is described as a ""Nobel Memorial Prize"" or similar Considerations: It is difficult to simultaneously hold Chinese citizenship and citizenship of another country. According to the Nationality Law of the PRC: ""Any Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality."" ""Any person born abroad whose parents are both Chinese nationals and [sic - I presume ""or"" would be more accurate] one of whose parents is a Chinese national shall have Chinese nationality. But a person whose parents are both Chinese nationals and have both settled abroad, or one of whose parents is a Chinese national and has settled abroad, and who has acquired foreign nationality at birth shall not have Chinese nationality."" ""Settled abroad"" seems to mean ""have established permanent residence in a country that isn't the PRC"". As mentioned above, only three Nobel laureates were PRC citizens at the time of their award. However, the two winners of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics represent an interesting edge case. They were both born in the Republic of China, the state that ruled over mainland China prior to the PRC, and were citizens of that country. However, they moved abroad a few years before the formation of the PRC was declared by Mao Zedong in 1949, and thus did not acquire PRC citizenship. Technically, they remained citizens of the Republic of China. The process for nominating people for a Nobel Prize has already begun. If the linked schedule is correct for this year, winners will be announced by each Nobel Committee in early October 2019, and the award ceremony will be held in December 2019.

1200,Will a reddit submission get a score of 100k on (approximately) December 15th 2018?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M1605,"reddit is a social news aggregator and the 21st most visited site globally. Users submit links, images or text to 'subreddit' communities on the site which are then voted and commented on by other users. A score are given for each submission that has some relationship to the number of 'upvotes' minus the number of 'downvotes'. This question asks the following: Will the ""top submissions over the last 24 hours"" on https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=day include a submission with a score of at least 100,000 on December 15th 2018? Details: To counter vote manipulation, reddit applies a form of 'fuzzing' to each post's score, such that the precise value shown varies slightly on each refresh. This means that different users see different scores for the same post. To prevent ambiguity in the resolution, the scores of the ""top submissions over the last 24 hours"" will be defined as the scores shown on the most recent snapshot of the site on archive.org with a listed time after December 14th 2018 23:59 GMT. archive.org has produced at least one snapshot of that page on most individual days over the past few months. However, there is a chance that no snapshot will be produced on December 15th (GMT), so it's possible that the actual snapshot used for the resolution will have been captured one or more days after that date.","['Computing – Internet', 'Technology – Internet']"

They are fascinating, unusual and mysterious: Firstly, they are the first ancient hominin whose existence was inferred not by analysis of fossil features, but by analysing DNA – from a pinky finger bone. Secondly, all confirmed Denisovan samples are teeth and fragments of bone found only in a single cave in Siberia. Thirdly, DNA derived from Denisovans or their close relatives makes up around 5% of the genomes of many Melanesian and Aboriginal Australian groups, and a lower but non-zero proportion for other Asians as well as Amerindians. Fourthly, the genetic adaptation of Tibetans and Sherpas to high-altitude living was achieved by at least one Denisovan-derived variant. Fifthly, an astounding discovery was presented earlier in 2018 in the form of a first-generation hybrid between a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. Including the hybrid, the genetic data of only five Denisovans has been published to date. This question asks the following: Between January 1st and June 30th 2019 inclusive, will a scientific paper be published describing genetic data from a new Denisova hominin? Details: The genetic data must be from a new individual, and thus cannot be a previously described individual sequenced to higher coverage The full genetic data for the individual must be described in the paper as being at least 40% Denisovan in ancestry. For instance, a Denisovan mitochondrial genome will fulfil resolution criteria, as will nuclear DNA from another first-generation hybrid. Edge case: if the individual is described as having (fully) Denisovan mitochondrial DNA but < 40% nuclear Denisovan DNA, this individual will not be considered a ""Denisovan"" If the individual is described in the paper as a ""Denisovan relative"" rather than a ""Denisovan"", this will not fulfil resolution criteria The paper must describe the results of at least one ""analysis"" of the Denisovan genetic data; if the data, or an analysis of the data, is described briefly as ""in review"" or ""unpublished"", this will not fulfil resolution criteria If under 5,000 bases are called for the individual, this will not fulfil resolution criteria The genetic material must be unambiguously assigned to a single individual, thus excluding metagenomic data such as that extracted from sediment The scientific paper must be published in a ""mainstream"" journal, such that it follows the definition of a Metaculus ""credible source"" Preprints on bioRxiv or other preprint repositories will not fulfil resolution criteria The publish date must be between the dates listed; if the article has a second, earlier date than the published date that is described as ""early access"", ""published online at"" or similar, this date cannot be used to fulfil resolution criteria","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Biological Sciences – Evolutionary Biology']"

1204,"Before July 1st 2019, will Ancestry.com announce that they have 'stored' or 'tested' (or similar language) the genetic information of at least 20 million individuals?","['yes', 'no']",no,M1610,"The direct-to-consumer personal genomics industry has entered an exponential growth phase. AncestryDNA is one service in this industry. It is offered by Ancestry.com, a genealogy website with Mormon roots. The AncestryDNA database reached 10 million individuals at some point over the summer, a fact advertised on their website. And a press release four days ago (November 29th 2018) states that they have sold ""14 million DNA kits"", although it's not clear if this number has a one-to-one relationship with the number of people whose genetic information is 'in their database'. (From experience, there can be quite some time between buying a kit and your results being accessible.) AncestryDNA is also stepping on the toes of more human biology–oriented services such as 23andMe – it recently launched a product called AncestryDNA Traits, which attempts to quantify your genetic propensity to curly hair, a cleft chin, and other such frivolous characteristics. While customers may buy their kits simply to find out what percent Native American they are, the growth of direct-to-consumer genomics has broader implications for medical research, criminal justice and family relationships. This question asks the following: Before July 1st 2019, will Ancestry.com announce that they have 'stored' or 'tested' (or similar language) the genetic information of at least 20 million individuals? Details: Credible sources, materials on the official Ancestry.com website, and press releases or documentation unambiguously attributed to Ancestry.com or its official subsidiaries can be used for positive resolution AncestryDNA refers often to the number of people 'tested' or to 'kits sold'; I assume that this is partly because the matter of whether they 'have' or 'own' the data is a fairly complicated legal matter. It seems that AncestryDNA owns 'licenses' over the genetic data of the individuals who sign up to the service, and the individuals themselves maintain ownership over their own genetic data. For this reason, it's hard to predict precisely what language they will use to describe the number of people 'in their database'. Fortunately, the precise verb they use in relation to the number of individuals will probably not lead to contestable ambiguity in the question resolution. But with regards to the matter of 'kits sold', see below: The statement used to confirm positive resolution should ideally be focused on the number of people; if the statement mentions instead the number of kits sold, and it is not unambiguously clear that the same number of people have been 'tested' by AncestryDNA or that their genetic information is 'in the database', or similar language indicating that they have actually generated the digitised genetic data of this number of people, then the statement cannot be used for positive resolution, unless the community consensus decides otherwise, for instance due to the statement's context In the event that Ancestry.com in some way 'acquires' another genetic database, and the new number of individuals 'in AncestryDNA's database' goes above 20 million, the question resolves positive only if these new individuals are somehow integrated into the system, for instance such that these new individuals are searchable in AncestryDNA's genetic relative–finding service If Ancestry.com starts offering a service which allows people to upload onto their site genetic data generated from other sources, in the manner of other services like MyHeritage, any statement used to support positive resolution must convey unambiguously that the number mentioned is the number of individuals whose digitised genetic data was generated by, from DNA samples gathered by, Ancestry.com, its subsidiaries, or registered contractors","['Biological Sciences – Genetics', 'Human Sciences – General', 'Industry – Health', 'Technology – Biotech']"

1223,"Will President Trump fire Jerome Powell, or ask him to resign, with Powell acceding to that request?","['yes', 'no']",no,M1671,"The Federal Reserve System (also known as the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States of America. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. The Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the head of the Federal Reserve. The chair is chosen by the President of the United States from among the members of the Board of Governors; and serves for four-year-terms after appointment. A chair may be appointed for several consecutive terms. William Martin was the longest serving chair, holding the position from 1951 to 1970. As stipulated by the Banking Act of 1935, the President of the United States appoints the seven members of the Board of Governors; they must then be confirmed by the Senate and serve fourteen year terms. The nominees for chair and vice-chair may be chosen by the President from among the sitting Governors for four-year terms; these appointments are also subject to Senate confirmation. The Senate Committee responsible for vetting a Federal Reserve Chair nominee is the Senate Committee on Banking. Jerome Hayden ""Jay"" Powell is the 16th and current Chair of the Federal Reserve, serving in that office since February 2018. He was nominated to the Fed Chair position by President Donald Trump, and confirmed by the United States Senate. Since Powell took the position of Fed Chair, the performance of major US equity indicies has been disappointing. President Trump has indicated that he is unhappy with the Fed's decision to raise interest rates several times this year. This has raised questions over whether Trump will try to replace Powell with a more accomodative Fed Chair. According to Bloomberg, ""any attempt by Trump to push out Powell would have potentially devastating ripple effects across financial markets, undermining investors’ confidence in the central bank’s ability to shepherd the economy without political interference. It would come as markets have plummeted in recent weeks, with the major stock indexes already down sharply for the year."" Section 10.2 of the Federal Reserve Act provides that upon the expiration of the term of any appointive member of the Federal Reserve Board in office on the date of enactment of the Banking Act of 1935, the President shall fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed fourteen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomination, but in such manner as to provide for the expiration of the term of not more than one member in any two-year period, and thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President. So far, no Fed Chairman has been removed by a President. Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) outlines the President's authority to remove appointed officials. Given that there is no precedent for a President attempting to fire a Fed Chairman, it is not entirely clear whether the President has the absolute authority to do so. In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers. The latter may be removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress; the former serve at the pleasure of the President and may be removed at his discretion. The legal question on Presidential authority hinges on which of these positions the Federal Reserve Chairman is found to occupy. This question asks: Will President Trump fire Jerome Powell, or ask him to resign, with Powell acceding to that request? This question resolves positively if credible media reports in the U.S. financial press state that Jerome Powell has left the position of Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and that he was either fired or asked by Trump or the Trump Administration to resign from the office. It resolves negatively if Powell leaves of his own accord (e.g. to retire or pursue other opportunities, or in protest against Trump Administration policy or Trump himself), or if he leaves for reasons other than those outlined above (e.g. death, disability, incapacity, et cetera), or if his term of office expires and he is not appointed to a new term, does not seek a new term, or refuses to accept a new term. The question also resolves negatively if Jerome Powell is still Fed Chairman when Donald Trump ceases to be President of the United States.","['Politics – US', 'Finance']"

Orlando Police Department (OPD) officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff. In a 9-1-1 call shortly after the shooting began, Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month ""triggered"" the shooting. He later told a negotiator he was ""out here right now"" because of the American-led interventions in Iraq and in Syria and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing.

For those losing track of Musk's repeated renaming of the project Wikipedia provides up-to date section on BFR nomenclature. About renaming BFR to Starship, Musk's has said: Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons) All rockets capable of reaching Earth's orbit with useful payload are built with at least two stages. Sometimes more. This is due to Rocket Equation. Dumping the dead weight of an empty first stage allows for more efficient use of energy. Super Heavy Starship (or BFR) is also built with two stages: the first stage is called ""Super Heavy"" and the second stage is called ""Starship"" (or BFS). An interesting aspect of the Starship is that it will be able to fly without the Super Heavy. That will allow it to return from other planets and moons to the Earth. It will also be capable of single stage to orbit launch from the Earth without any useful payload. The capability is intended to be used for testing of entering planets atmospheres from super orbital velocities like Mars/Moon transfer velocities.

Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys & new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized. Scott Manley has nice discussion of the new approach. Will SpaceX start testing a Starship (BFS) before 2020? The question will resolve positively if we get information from SpaceX in the form of a video or a photo showing that any early test version of Starship/BFS (the second or upper stage) has been launched before 1 January 2020.

(Bioweapons programs, if they exist despite international treaty, are secret and/or classified.) Nonetheless, some research and research publication have encountered criticism for potentially increasing the risk of accidental pandemic, or deliberate bioweapon attack. In a prominent example, in 2012 a Dutch research group published a description of a lab-modified strain of H5N1 influenza virus capable of airborne transmission between ferrets. This came after intense controversy including a recommendation-then-reversal by the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) that the research not be published. See here for summary and an update on the story. Gain-of-function research of the type described in these publications has been under a funding moratorium in the US since 2014; however as detailed in a separate question, the research may be ""allowed"" in some cases in the US, and can continue elsewhere or using alternative funding. This raises questions about the publication of such information, and the responsibility of journals (if any) in deciding whether it should be published. Following up to a previous question from 2016, which resolved negatively, we again ask: By Jan 1, 2021 will an event occur in which a credible media source reports that a major medical journal has declined to publish an otherwise-publishable scientific paper on human pathogens due to concerns that it constitutes an information hazard?

Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR. The parliament of the Republic proclaimed the sovereignty of Belarus on 27 July 1990, and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has served as the country's first president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled ""Europe's last dictatorship"" by some Western journalists on account of Lukashenko's self-described authoritarian style of government. Elections under Lukashenko's rule have been widely criticized as unfair; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus is also the last country in Europe using the death penalty.

Much more audacious is the possibility of transplanting a human head. (Or should it be considered a full-body transplant?) The difficulties are obviously daunting: not just the spine, but major arteries, throat, etc., must all be reattached while keeping the brain alive. Recently, the media has been abuzz with news that Sergio Canavero and his colleague Xiaoping Ren of China plan to transplant a human head from a living person onto a donor cadaver. The two surgeons — who portray themselves as pioneers defying a stodgy medical establishment but are considered reckless renegades by many peers — say the head donor will be someone with a degenerative disease, whose body is wasting away while his or her mind remains active. The body donor, meanwhile, will likely be a someone who died of severe head trauma but whose body was left unscathed.

The disappearance of Flight 370 is considered one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time. The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft last communicated with air traffic control (ATC) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later, but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea. It left radar range 200 nautical miles (370 km) northwest of Penang Island in northwestern Malaysia. With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead, the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest incident of Malaysia Airlines' history, until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 four months later. The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in December 2014.

1240,Will there be rioting in the UK or Gibraltar if the UK is still in the EU on 30 March 2019?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M1866,"The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 at 23:00 London time, following a referendum held in June 2016 in which 51.89% of voters voted to leave the EU, and 48.11% voted to remain. As the closeness of the result suggests, this has been a very controversial affair within the UK. It has also proven difficult for UK and EU negotiators to agree on the terms of the exit, and the deal currently on the table (which EU officials say is not renegotiable) seems unlikely to be acceptable to the UK Parliament; but few want a no-deal exit, and it is widely (though not universally) felt that the referendum result makes remaining in the EU unacceptable. In this difficult situation, one concern is that some options might be so unacceptable to some or all of the UK's population that they would lead to protests, violence or even insurrection. Metaculus already has a question asking whether this will happen if Brexit goes ahead on schedule. This question, conversely, asks: will there be rioting in the UK or Gibraltar if Brexit is cancelled or delayed? This question resolves ambiguously if Brexit occurs on schedule on 29 March 2019. Otherwise, it resolves positively if credible media reports indicate that rioting has taken place anywhere in the United Kingdom or Gibraltar as a result of the delay or cancellation. For positive resolution, the rioting must occur within 30 days of 23:00 London time 29 March 2019 and must directly result in damages to property (cars, shops, windows, etc.) amounting to at least £100,000 (≈$126,900).

He previously served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007 and was the Republican Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In January 2019, just days before taking his seat in the Senate, Romney published an excoriating op-ed regarding President Trump's leadership in the Washington Post. This, coupled with Romney's previous claim that 'Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud' has caused some speculation that he may challenge the incumbent President in the Republican primaries before the 2020 Presidential Election. On 03 January 2019, Romney denied having any plans to challenge Trump in the Republican primaries. As of 03 January 2019, Donald Trump is the only declared candidate in those primaries. This question asks: Before 3 February 2020, the date of the Iowa caucus, will Mitt Romney declare himself a candidate in the Republican primaries for the 2020 Presidential Election cycle, in the event that Donald Trump is also a candidate? Resolves positive if the above is true, resolves negative if Trump is a candidate and Romney does not before 3 February 2020 declare himself to be a candidate at any time that Trump is also a candidate, and resolves ambiguously if, before Romney makes a declaration of candidacy, Trump ceases to be candidate in the Republican primaries for any reason.","['Politics – US', 'Elections – U.S. – President', 'Elections – U.S.']"

Held every year, it attracts large numbers of attendees, causing tickets to sell out within twelve minutes last year. Around the world, ML researchers furiously scramble to prepare papers in time to submit, as NeurIPS is also regarded as the most prestigious publication venue in ML. Each year, once the list of accepted papers is released, people invariably calculate which institutions and authors have contributed the most papers, or the most first authorships. One relatively easy-to-check stat is for each institution, how many accepted papers have an author affiliated with that institution. In 2017 (when the conference was called NIPS) and 2018, the top institution was Google Research, by a large margin. However, the university rankings are somewhat more competitive: in 2017, Carnegie Mellon (CMU) was at the top, while in 2018, MIT took the lead. CMU also does well at the other leading ML conference, ICML, where it took top or equal top spot among universities in both 2017 and 2018.

From Vox's Future Perfect 2019 Series, which originally ran 1.15.19: The things that would have to happen for the UK to backtrack on Brexit before its planned departure from the EU on March 29 seem, on their own, quite unlikely to me, and less likely when put together. Option 1 is that Theresa May calls a new referendum (Updated PredictIt price: 8 cents) and then “Remain” wins, which polling suggests is possible, though the margins are close. Option 2 is that the Conservatives’ Democratic Unionist Party partners break from the coalition, forcing a new election (Updated PredictIt Price: 4 cents), Jeremy Corbyn and Labour win (it’s tight), and they either cancel Brexit unilaterally or call a new referendum. Corbyn publicly pretended to support Remain during the referendum, but I think it’s pretty obvious he wants to leave the EU, and in any case, he’ll never go that far out on a limb to prevent Brexit from happening. —DM Future Perfect's prediction: 80%** The question resolves positive if The UK leaves with an withdrawal agreement in 2019 with a transitional period (during which time the UK and EU continues to operate under Single Market rules) ending in or before 2025. The UK leaves without a withdrawal agreement in 2019 (i.e. a ""no-deal"" Brexit occurs) (clarification, March 2, 2019) positive resolution need not require ratification of the terms of UK's exit, and therefore a ""no-deal"" counts toward a positive resolution.

For this series, we've Metaculus-ized a smattering for your delectation. We suggest you start with the first question in the series, here. From Vox's Future Perfect 2019 Series, which originally ran 1.15.19: My standard here is PredictWise, a website that collates odds from bookies and prediction markets to estimate the likelihood that bettors — people putting down actual money predicting the 2020 primaries — assign to various candidates. This prediction will hold up if no Democrat’s odds of winning the nomination break 50 percent at any point during 2019. Someone in the crowded Democratic field might truly break out and start trouncing everybody. In 2003, Howard Dean’s star rose so much that the Iowa Electronic Markets started giving him a greater than 50 percent chance of winning the nomination. But that seems unusual. Bob Dole didn’t crack 50 percent until pretty late in the 1996 cycle, which he dominated to a far greater degree than I expect anyone to in 2020. No Republican in 2007 came close —DM.

From Vox's Future Perfect 2019 Series, which originally ran 1.15.19: My intuitions about questions like these are often surprisingly off. I intuitively consider the question, Is this trending upward or downward? But that’s far from the only thing that matters when predicting whether this year’s temperatures will be higher than last year’s. It’s also important to have a sense of how noisy the trend is. I looked at this data from NASA to see how I would have done making this prediction every year from 2002 to the present. I’d have been right 10 times and wrong six times. My understanding is that if you have a clear understanding of El Niño and La Niña, and how they affect global temperature patterns, you can do better than that — but I don’t and I can’t.

He caveats that doesn't mean the autopilot will always work, instead claiming Tesla will enter the “march of nines”, increasing certainty incrementally. That being said he has little influence on the regulators’ confidence, certainty, and conservatism, which can vary a lot between jurisdictions. Currently, Tesla's automated driving features is currently classified as a level 2 on the a five level scale according to the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE International) five levels of vehicle automation. By the end of 2020, will Tesla roll out autopilot features that are classified by SAE International as level 4 or 5 on their 2016 five point scale? Resolves positive when: Autopilot of described SAE level 4 or 5, as defined by SAE international's 2016 classification, is rolled out on at least county level anywhere (may not be the US). SAE level 4 is characterized as (""mind off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, and no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control. SAE level 5 is defined as Level 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi. Resolves positive if any autopilot system, or ""feature"" released by Tesla before the end of 2020 is is judged by experts and/or common consensus to meet SAE's 2016 classification as level 4 or above. Note that this judgement may occur after 2020, but must involve an autopilot system or version released before the end of 2020.","['Industry – Transportation', 'Infrastructure']"

However, one year before it first hit $1 trillion, it was worth ~$0.8 trillion (which would have resolved a similar question negative). Amazon's rise was even more impressive. Amazon has grown from $100 bn to $1 trillion in just over 6 years. And one year before it hit $1 trillion, it was worth ~0.46 trillion (which would have resolved a similar question positive). Will the first publicly traded company to have a $2 trillion market cap be worth double what it was worth 1 year before reaching $2 trillion? This resolves when a company whose shares can be bought and sold on a stock exchange achieves a market capitalisation of $2 trillion (adjusted to 2018 prices), AND it was worth less than or equal to $1 trillion one year before (also in 2018 prices). The question will refer to Yahoo Finance's data, or any other reputable financial data service.

A withdrawal agreement was negotiated by November last year. It was endorsed by leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries. However, it has not been ratified by UK's parliament, as May's deal was defeated twice. The speaker of the House of Commons ruled out third meaningful vote on same deal, making it necessary to postpone leaving to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

This first election was quite controversial, but adhered to nevertheless. The 2004 election were a vast improvement, reflecting the Algerian people's desire to see Bouteflika's rule continued. In 2008 a constitutional amendment allowed Bouteflika to run for and win a third term, under protest and boycott from opposition parties. Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013, but that didn't stop him from running for a 4th term in 2014. During that campaign and after his win, with far smaller participation numbers anbd under boycott from opposition parties, he was seen less and less in public. He announced his candidacy for the 2019 election via press release, which resulted in protest, internet censorship, the retraction of his candidacy and an unspecified postponement of the election. Now the protesters seek Bouteflika to be deemed unfit, which would result in the President of the Senate and incidentally friend of Bouteflika, Abdelkader Bensalah, becoming Acting President for the 90 days until elections would be held.

However, the process has been fraught with difficulty and the British government has been unable to win enough support in Parliament to ratify Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiated withdrawal agreement. As a result of the deadlock, the UK has been granted an extension until 31 October 2019 following a Euopean Council meeting on 10 April. If a deal is not reached by this date, the legal default position is that the UK will exit the EU with no deal on this date.

1295,"Before 1 January 2022, will the US Food and Drug Administration grant regulatory approval allowing any device developed in whole or in part by Neuralink Corporation to be implanted into the brain of a living human?","['yes', 'no']",no,M2951,"Neuralink Corporation is an American neurotechnology company founded in 2016 by serial entrepreneur Elon Musk and others, developing implantable brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). Since its founding, the company has hired several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities. By July 2019, it had received $158 million in funding (of which $100 million from Musk) and was employing a staff of 90 employees. At that time, Neuralink announced that it was working on a “sewing machine-like” robot capable of implanting very thin ""threads"" into the brain, demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat's brain via thousands of electrodes (many times more than the current maximum for systems used in human brains), and Musk announced an aspirational goal to start experiments with humans in 2020, pending FDA approval. In the short term, the company aims to develop brain-machine interfaces to assist individuals with serious physical or neurological conditions; but the longer term goal of the company is to enable human-AI symbiosis and grant superhuman cognition to anyone who wants it, as well as a form of digital immortality. Needless to say, if these more ambitious developments are actually possible, this technology would enable a radically different future to emerge. Enhancing human cognition may be the most important thing we could ever possibly do. Elon Musk: ""From a long-term existential standpoint... the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high-bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI."" (See 00:35 in the video.) ""It will enable anyone who wants to have superhuman cognition... anyone who wants."" (See 02:55 in the video.) ""You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time. If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload into a new unit. Literally."" (See 05:55 in the video.) You can watch the company's July 2019 presentation here, and read their paper An integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels here. This question asks: Before 1 January 2022, will the US Food and Drug Administration grant regulatory approval allowing any device developed in whole or in part by Neuralink Corporation to be implanted into the brain of a living human? You can find information on the FDA's Regulatory Overview for Neurological Devices here. The implantation surgery need not actually occur by that date (or at all) in order for this question to resolve positively; this question focuses solely on whether regulatory approval will be obtained before 1 January 2022. Note that any such regulatory approval that allows the implantation of any qualifying device in the brain of a living human will trigger a positive resolution, including (but not limited to) the grant of an Investigational Device Exemption or a Humanitarian Device Exemption. In particular, note that this question does not require full regulatory approval to market and sell any device to the public in order for a positive resolution. Resolves ambiguously if the FDA is abolished before 2022, or if its role is changed such that regulatory approval is no longer required for this procedure.","['Human Sciences – Cognitive Science', 'Biology – Medicine – Clinical Trials', 'Biological Sciences – Neuroscience']"

And we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe. So, the question is: will Brexit - an event after which UK is no longer part of the EU - occur by the end of the day (UTC) October 31, 2019? The question resolves positively if UK is no longer part of the European Union by the end of the day October 31, and negatively if it still remains substantially in its current status. For the purposes of the question, the cutoff point is defined as the moment when the treaties of the EU cease to apply to the UK. This can happen, for example: by withdrawal agreement between UK and EU, or by the end of the negotiating period as set out by Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (provided it is not extended further without any change in status happening - in this case the resolution is negative), repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act, etc. If the agreement specifies that the UK is no longer part of the EU, and is in force by October 31, the resolution is positive even if implementation of some parts of the agreement - e.g. trade deals or customs regime or visa policy - is happening past October 31. If the UK leaves the EU but parts of the UK remain in the EU (e.g. Scotland, Northern Ireland) with some kind of special status, the resolution is still positive as long as the main part of the UK - the one inheriting the current government structure - leaves the EU. If there is the substantial change in status, but the links with EU are not severed completely, e.g. if some special status for the whole UK is introduced which is intermediate between full membership and full withdrawal, the resolution is ambiguous.",['Politics – European']

Source arXiv.org is an online archive of research articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv is owned and operated by Cornell University. See more information on arXiv.org. Methodology The keywords we selected, and their respective categories, are below: Artificial intelligence (cs.AI) Computation and language (cs.CL) Computer vision and pattern recognition (cs.CV) Machine learning (cs.LG) Neural and evolutionary computing (cs.NE) Robotics (cs.RO) Machine learning in stats (stats.ML) For most categories, arXiv provided data years 1999 — 2017.

To see other categories’ submission rates on arXiv, see arXiv.orgs submission statistics. Nuance Categories are self-identified by authors — those shown are selected as the “primary” category. Therefore, it is worth noting that there is not one streamlined categorization process. Additionally, the Artificial intelligence or Machine learning categories may be categorized by other subfields / keywords. arXiv team members have shared that participation on arXiv can breed more participation — meaning that an increase in a subcategory on arXiv could drive over-indexed participation by certain communities. Growth of papers on arXiv does not reflect actual growth of papers on that topic. Some growth can be attributed to arXiv.org’s efforts to increase their paper count, or to the increasing importance of dissemination by AI communities.

Common psychedelic drugs include mescaline, LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Many psychedelic drugs are illegal worldwide under the UN conventions, occasionally excepting use in a religious or research context. Despite these controls, recreational use of psychedelics is common, with Krebs and Johansen, 2013 estimating that there are over 30 million psychedelic users in the United States.

The fingertip is the only part of the human limb that is regeneration‐competent (Dolan et al., 2018). The regenerating mouse digit tip has emerged as a model to study a clinically relevant regenerative response. According to (Dolan et al., 2018), this is for good reason: Studies of digit tip regeneration have identified critical components of the regenerative response, and how an understanding of endogenous regeneration can lead to expanding the regenerative capabilities of nonregenerative amputation wounds. Such studies demonstrate that regeneration‐incompetent wounds can respond to treatment with individual morphogenetic agents by initiating a multi‐tissue response that culminates in structural regeneration.

This would force a special recall vote with an up-down on the recall and votes for a possible replacement. Under California law, any elected official may be the target of a recall campaign. To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office. Under most circumstances in which a recall campaign against a statewide elected official has gathered the required number of signatures, the governor is required to schedule a special election for the recall vote. If the recall campaign qualified less than 180 days prior to the next regularly scheduled election, then the recall becomes part of that regularly scheduled election. In recall of the governor, the responsibility for scheduling a special election falls on the lieutenant governor. The recall ballot has two components: * a yes or no vote for recall, and the names of replacement candidates, selected by the nomination process used in regular elections. * The recall measure itself is successful if it passes by a majority. In that case, the replacement candidate with a simple plurality of votes wins the office. If the recall measure fails, the replacement candidate votes are ignored.

In particular, the preamble to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 explains that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering, thereby acknowledging this capacity in non-human animals. However, the legislation does not extend to poultry, fish, rabbits or other animals routinely slaughtered for food.[1] In China, the recognition of non-human animal sentience is very limited: according to Wold Animal Protection, only a couple Chinese legislative articles refer to the humane treatment of animals and measures to ensure that the animals in question do not suffer, whereas most articles regulating the treatment of animals do not. In 2017, the USA produced the most beef and veal, and poultry in the world, whilst China produces the most Pork in the world.[2] The US received a D and China received an E in WAP's 2014 index. Will the Animal Protection Index award either the USA or China with a higher grade than received it in the 2014 index for its recognition of animal sentience by the end 2022? Resolution This question resolves positively if either the USA receives a grade of C or above, or China receives a grade D or above (or both), in the second edition of the Animal Protection Index, planned to be released in early 2020. This question resolves ambiguously if the grades for China and the USA for the indicator ""Formal Recognition of Animal Sentience"" are not issued before the end of 2022. This question shall be retroactively closed and resolved two days before the second edition of the Animal Protection Index is released.","['Animal Welfare Series', 'Legislative efforts and industry standards']"

A careful analysis posted in an April 2016 paper suggests that this anomaly is consistent with the existence of a hitherto unknown light (17 MeV) vector boson. Since then, interest in this potential new physics has grown, though it is tempered by concern about the experimental group and its previous work; see this story for a nice summary. As discussed in this story, several ongoing or proposed experiments may be able to independently test the possibility of a new vector boson in this mass range in the next year or two, and it is possible that another team could independently reproduce the original nuclear physics experiment. A previous question by our glorious leader Anthony resolved on Jan 9, 2018 with no new evidence on the matter. Theoretical work has continued on the subject since (see google scholar) and in October 2019, the original Hungarian group uploaded a new paper to the arxiv where they report observing similar anomalous decays of excited He atoms. Question: By beginning of 2021, will no independent group publish or post to the arxiv a paper adducing additional experimental evidence for a new vector boson in the mass range of 10-50 MeV? By independent, we mean that the paper will not share authors with either the PRL experimental paper or the Feng et al. theoretical paper; by ""adduce experimental evidence"" we will include both new experiments providing evidence at > 3-sigma or equivalent, or a new theoretical analysis of data other than that of the Hungarian group providing at least 4-sigma or equivalent evidence.",['Physical Sciences – General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology']

The statement concluded: What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get This is hardly the first time the North Korean government has employed this type of threatening metaphor. For example, the AP notes that: After the North tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile in July 2017, Kim called the missile a “package of gifts” to the Americans for their Fourth of July holiday. There are a variety of possible gifts the North Koreans could have in mind, including A nuclear weapon test, A ballistic missile test, An attack on a military target, or An attack on a civilian target... ...or maybe nothing at all! KCNA is full of hyperbolic, aggressive propaganda. North Korea is not the most reliable gift-giver. This could very well be just another bluff. Accordingly, I ask: Will North Korea fail to send the U.S. a Christmas gift? This question resolves negatively if North Korea does (or attempts) any of the following: Launching an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile test. Testing a nuclear weapon. Committing an act of war in which at least one person is injured. Any inflammatory acts judged by Metaculus Admins to be commensurate to those listed above. This question resolves positively if by New Year's day (on-time gifting is hard!), North Korea has not committed any of the above.

CRISPR/Cas9 is a technique that allows for the highly specific and rapid modification of DNA in a genome. On 25 November 2018, a Chinese scientist named He Jiankui made a startling announcement: as a result of experiments conducted at his clinic, the world’s first genetically edited babies, Lulu and Nana, had been born (Regalado, 2018b). After Jiankui’s announcement, Vox asked “Is the CRISPR baby controversy the start of a terrifying new chapter in gene editing?” and a lot of other people also had the same question. But the answer (so far) seems to be no. A Chinese court has sentenced He Jiankui, to three years in prison for “illegal medical practice”, and handed down shorter sentences to two colleagues who assisted him (Cyranoski, 2020). No new babies edited with CRISPR were announced this past year. According to Vox's Kelsey Piper: The fierce global backlash against Jiankui made it clear that the world is uncomfortable with such uses of technology — rightfully so, as there’s immense potential for misuse and Jiankui’s experiments were enormously irresponsible. I bet it won’t happen again this year — though I’m sure it’ll happen again someday. Will no CRISPR-edited babies be born in the year 2020? This question resolves positively, if by the end of 2021, no credible reports have emerged that a baby was born in the year 2020 whose embryo was genetically edited by way of a CRISPR system, such as CAS9.

1345,"In the year 2020, will no gene drive be launched to fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes in any part of the world?","['yes', 'no']",yes,M3483,"Gene drives are phenomena in a species' population in which one version of a gene, or allele, is probabilistically favored over other alleles that are otherwise equally favored by fitness. A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes engineered gene drives tractable: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being ""driven,"" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one ""wild"" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited. This process can spread the driven gene exponentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival. Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. Valentino Gantz et. al. have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another study published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated engineering mice (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease. With Malaria afflicting hundreds of millions of people per year, advances in gene drive research have instigated public conversations about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems. In the year 2020, will no gene drive be launched to fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes in any part of the world? For negative resolution, there must be credible reports that the drive was initiated. For the purpose of this question, the wild population can be isolated (say on an island or even in an enclosure) to control spreading but should aim to replicate natural reproduction etc., and cannot be a laboratory setting.

The UK leaves without a withdrawal agreement in 2020 (i.e. a ""no-deal"" Brexit occurs).

The effects of increased global surface temperatures, and the associated changes in climate include: Increases in the frequency and intensity of intense precipitation (Min et al., 2011), and increases in the proportion of the global land surface in extreme drought (Burke et al., 2006), Global sea level rise (Vermeer and Rahmstorf), which in turn may result in the erosion of beaches and coastal wetlands, increased flooding, and intrusion of saltwater into rivers, bays, and aquifers (Titus, 2008), and global ocean warming and acidification (Pörtner, 2008), Adverse effects to human health, due to thermal stress, and the increased prevalence of infectious diseases (McMichael et al., 2006), and increased food security risk (Zhao et al., 2017; FAO, 2008), Loss of terrestrial biodiversity at all system levels, including species-level reductions in range size and abundance, especially amongst endemic species (Warren et al., 2013).

(This is called reference class forecasting, where you predict a statistic by looking at what prediction would have been correct in recent years or in other events like this one.) Why are CO2 levels still increasing? Well, global population is still increasing (though more slowly than ever) and our efforts to decrease greenhouse gas emissions have been...lackluster, to say the least. Major polluters have made only token steps to reduce their emissions, and no country has cut their emissions as fast as the IPCC says that we need to. That’s a scary trend, and it makes me deeply unhappy.

In 2020, I predict we’ll see at least three more cities institute a ban on the controversial tech. To be clear, I’m talking about a ban that applies to city departments like police; I think outright bans that would also cover businesses, individuals, and federal agencies are way less likely. I’m partly going off local news about particular cities — Portland is currently deliberating over a ban, and the western Massachusetts city of Springfield might be next. Last year saw mounting pushback against facial recognition from AI researchers, groups like the ACLU, low-income tenants in Brooklyn, and many more. Their protests seem to be growing bolder, not quieter. I should note that according to Pew Research Center survey data, most Americans are now in favor of police using facial recognition. I don’t think a nationwide ban is in the cards for 2020 (sorry, Bernie). But a lot can still happen on the city level, and I think it will.

Democrats lost seats in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, and West Virginia that they’re basically not contesting this time around. Iowa and Montana look only slightly better. Instead, Democrats’ hopes rest on the two 2014 losses they think they can reverse — in North Carolina and Colorado — as well as a special election in Arizona, an unlikely Alabama seat they won in 2017, and Susan Collins’ once-safe seat in Maine that they’re hoping her vote for Kavanaugh will make competitive. Sweeps of this magnitude do happen (2006 and 2008 both saw huge Democratic sweeps), they’re rare, especially as the parties have polarized geographically, and Democrats are underdogs in Alabama and North Carolina in particular. There’s a chance the Dems pull it out, but I think it’s quite unlikely. Will the GOP hold the Senate in 2020?

But I still have this feeling they’ll be over quickly. There’s the four early caucuses and primaries: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. Then on March 3rd, a large, demographically balanced (representing the overall Democratic electorate pretty well) set of states will vote. Two-person races often drag out well past Super Tuesday. But I think this four-person race might be primed to end pretty fast. Once a candidate has gotten a series of wins, voters might be pretty quick to rally behind them — and a Super Tuesday lead might quickly become insurmountable.

1355,Will Whole Woman's Health be overturned in 2020?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M3495,"Whole Woman's Health v. Hellersted, is a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 27, 2016. The Court ruled 5–3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. The landmark case ensures states must show proof of an actual health benefit when enacting or passing abortion laws. In December, Texas Attor­ney General Ken Paxton called on the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the legal challenge to a Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to obtain hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinic, and thereby essentially toss out the Whole Woman's Health ruling. According Vox's Dylan Matthews: This term, the Supreme Court will hear and rule in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Gee, a challenge to a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As my colleagues Anna North and Ian Millhiser explain, abortion rights advocates consider this restriction both medically unnecessary (the rate of complications for first-trimester abortions is very low, and you don’t need admitting privileges to send people with complications to a nearby hospital) and designed to shut down abortion clinics. But more importantly, the Supreme Court already struck down a nearly identical Texas law in 2016’s Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The fact that it’s hearing this case so soon after setting a precedent that admitting privileges laws are unconstitutional suggests strongly that the Court — which has since added Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and lost abortion rights supporter Anthony Kennedy — is ready to overrule Whole Women’s Health and allow more state restrictions on abortion. I think there’s a real, maybe 20-30 percent chance that the anti-abortion rights majority on the court overrules Roe v. Wade outright, pulling off the Band-aid and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion in one fell swoop, as many GOP politicians have urged them to do with this case. But whether or not Roe falls, I think it’s a near-certainty that Whole Women’s Health will fall. Will Whole Woman's Health be overturned in 2020? This question resolves positively if Vox, the NYT, WaPo, Reuters, Politico, or the Associated Press reports that the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellersted is effectively overturned before the end of 2020.",['Series – Future Perfect 2020']

1368,Will Michael Bloomberg emerge as the leading moderate candidate after Super Tuesday?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M3607,"Former Mayor of New York City and current Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg (b. 1942) has mounted a campaign with no precedent in US history. For one thing, he has refused to accept contributions and is instead self-funding his campaign; since entering the race in December last year, he has outspent all the other candidates combined. Because he has received no external funding, Bloomberg was also automatically disqualified from participating in all of the primary debates. In addition, Bloomberg has chosen not to compete in any of the first four states, regarded by many as critical for building momentum. His strategy is instead to focus on ""Super Tuesday"", the day—March 3rd—when the greatest number of U.S. states hold primary elections and caucuses, and when more delegates are at stake than on any other day during the primaries. Bloomberg's popularity has surged in recent polls; as of February 7th, he is polling at 11% nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight's poll aggregator. Pete Buttigieg, who won the most delegates in Iowa and has also seen a slight increase in popularity after this victory, is still only polling at 8%; while Joe Biden, the frontrunner until recently, had a singularly disappointing election, which may be repeated in New Hampshire, and generally appears to be running out of steam. These three candidates–Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg—may be considered the only moderate Democrats running with a realistic chance of winning the nomination. After Super Tuesday, one of them will likely emerge as the leading alternative to democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. A natural test of whether Bloomberg's strategy has succeeded is whether he comes to occupy this position. So we ask: Will Michael Bloomberg win more delegates than Biden and Buttigieg on Super Tuesday? Resolution The question resolves positively if Michael Bloomberg obtains more total delegates in the elections held on March 3, 2020 than are won by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg individually.

Prediction markets have offered an alternative to poll aggregation in forecasting elections. Markets such as (the now defunct) InTrade, the Iowa Electronic Markets, PredictIt, and others ask users to buy and sell shares assigned to each candidate in each race, so that the price point corresponds to the probability of victory. In this question we focus on PredictIt, which allows users to place relatively small real-money bets on candidates. Both fivethirtyeight.com and PredictIt have published probabilities for each of the 14 Super Tuesday Primaries on the Democratic side. (The races are California, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine, Vermont.) Which forecasts will prove to be more accurate? To compare, we will score each set of predictions using a Brier score averaged over all N=14 races, computed as S= 1 N ∑ i=1,N ∑ j=1, M i ( p ij − o ij ) 2 , where j enumerates the M i possible outcomes (i.e. possible winners) in the ith race out of N, where p ij is the forecast probability of candidate j winning the ith race, and o ij is assigned 1 if candidate j wins the ith race, and 0 otherwise. For example, if PredictIt assigned 52% to Sanders and 48% to Warren in the New York Democratic Primary and if Sanders won then PredictIt would achieve a Brier Score of S=(0.52−1 ) 2 +(0.48−0 ) 2 =0.4608. A lower Brier score is better, with perfect predictions corresponding to S=0. (In the case where PredictIt's prices do not add up to $1, we will normalize them to $1 to convert to probabilities.)

1380,Will the WHO or North Korean Government confirm any COVID-19 cases in North Korea by 2020-05-17?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M3709,"On 2020-02-19, the North Korean envoy to the UN claimed that North Korea has experienced no cases of COVID-19, the novel Coronavirus which appears to have emerged from Wuhan province in China late in 2019. The North Korean Government has, however, enacted a strict policy of quarantining persons entering the country found to be exhibiting signs of a fever. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also indicated that they do not have any evidence of an outbreak of COVID-19 in North Korea, though South Korean media has claimed that such an outbreak is indeed occurring, and news of it being repressed by the North Korean Government. Regardless of whether the possible pandemic has reached North Korea already, such temperature-based quarantines are of indeterminate effectiveness. A growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 may be transmissible by asymptomatic carriers, rendering symptom-based quaratine measures effectively useless. Thus, there are two questions of relevance to North Korea: first has or will COVID-19 reach its population in spite of the quarantine measures, and second, will the North Korean government affirm the breach? Alternately, will the WHO confirm a North Korean outbreak, regardless of whether the North Korean government announces it? Stated more succinctly, Will the WHO or North Korean Government confirm any COVID-19 cases in North Korea by 2020-05-17?

1381,Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2020-05-17?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M3710,"The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population. This latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response. Question: Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2020-05-17? Resolution This questions resolves positively if, before 2020-05-17, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.

Using current methods, an algorithm can gain new skills by exposure to large amounts of data, but cognitive abilities that could broadly generalize to many tasks remain elusive. This makes it very challenging to create systems that can handle the variability and unpredictability of the real world, such as domestic robots or self-driving cars. François Chollet, creator of the Keras neural network library, in the paper ""On measuring intelligence"" describes in detail the context and motivation behind a benchmark that is supposed to put the general, broad intelligence of machines to test. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) provides a benchmark to measure AI skill-acquisition on unknown tasks, with the constraint that only a handful of demonstrations are shown to learn a complex task. The setup is similar to the Raven's Progressive Matrices IQ test. You can inspect training examples here.

It is not approved anywhere globally for any use. According to its producer, Gilead Sciences: Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens MERS and SARS, which are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to COVID-19. The limited preclinical data on remdesivir in MERS and SARS indicate that remdesivir may have potential activity against COVID-19. From the National Institutes of Health: A randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha. The trial regulatory sponsor is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. This is the first clinical trial in the United States to evaluate an experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. “We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with COVID-19, we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes,” said NIAID Director and U.S. Coronavirus Task Force member Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients.” Will remdesivir be administered to at least 50,000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, UK, EU member states, and Japan, by the end of 2020? This question resolves positively if before the end of 2020, medical publications or credible media sources indicate that remdesivir has be administered to at least 50,000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, UK, EU member states, and Japan. For the purpose of this question, the process under which remdesivir is made available to patients does not matter.

1407,Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M3900,"Incidents of civil unrest are not terribly uncommon in the United States, but large-scale rioting is quite rare. One of the most severe incidents in recent history was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, during which more than 60 people were killed, more than 2,350 people were injured, and more than 12,000 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at more than $1bn. As of March 2020, the US is affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several large population centers have been effectively shut down as a result of government orders that attempt to slow the spread of the pandemic. As a result of the pandemic and associated economic shutdowns, incidents of panic buying have been reported, and dire predictions of severe economic contraction have been made. Given the potential socio-economic impact of the pandemic, it may become increasingly difficult for many people to maintain their employment or other income source, and as of March 22 2020 it is unclear if the US government will offer all citizens a sufficient measure of economic support during the crisis to maintain the social order. This question asks: Will the United States experience an incident of a massive riot in 2020? For the purposes of this question, 'massive riot' is defined as an event of rioting or civil unrest in which any of the following conditions is met: At least 50 people die due to violence, either due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. At least 10,000 people are arrested by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents. Property damages are credibly estimated at $1 billion or more. This estimate may come from either the local government of the locality in which the incident takes place, the state government, the federal government, or a major US news publication such as the New York Times, Washington Post, or major broadcast news networks. Such events should take place in a 100km radius, and within 14 days. As an example, the LA riots would count, but rioting that is spread across all of California or that occurs in separate phases over a long time period would not count if no single incident met any of the above criteria. Resolution should cite a government statement or credible news reports that indicate that any of the above conditions have been met by an event of rioting. ETA 2020-06-03: For homicides to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths have to occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count towards the 50.","['Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)', 'Social issues – Crime and Violence', 'Economy – US']"

Let's see if he's right! CDC's Wonder database gives us their annual count of deaths-by-suicide. From this, we can perform a simple linear regression to see that the number of suicides is increasing by roughly 1012 annually. The last year for which data are available (2018) had 48,312 suicides. Accordingly, we might predict that there were roughly 49,324 in 2019 and there would be around 50,336 in a business-as-usual 2020 scenario. Thus, to judge the President's prediction, let's see if there are at least 1000 suicides more than that. If the US experiences a recession in 2020, will the number of suicides in the US in 2020 exceed 51,336? For purposes of this question: A recession will be defined as two consecutive quarters of Negative GDP growth for the United States. If the US does not experience a recession, this question resolves ambiguously. The number of suicides will be the number reported by the CDC's Wonder database, or by a press release or other official publication by the National Center for Health Statistics reporting all deaths classified as any of ICD10 codes X60-X84 (Intentional self-harm).

There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally. As of 20 March 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) is reporting that it is tracking the development of forty-four SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines. Two of these candidates have entered phase one and the other forty-two remain in the pre-clinical stage. One of the candidates in phase one is a RNA vaccine candidate, as are seven of the candidates in the pre-clinical stage. RNA vaccines are of particular interest because they can be developed and produced relatively quickly since, unlike other vaccine platforms, they do not require fermentation or culture and instead use faster synthetic processes. As a result, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate to enter a phase one clinical trial is a RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which was developed by Moderna Therapeutics at record speed. While promising, RNA-based vaccine platforms are a new development and the field is still nascent. No RNA vaccine has ever made it to market. And since no RNA vaccine has been approved to date, there is an urgent need to determine the likelihood of successful development of such a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. This question asks: Will a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate be approved for use in the United States or European Union before 2022? Resolution will be determined via the first relevant press release made by the FDA, EMA, or European Commission regarding the approval of a RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In the United States, approval means that the vaccine candidate has been licensed by the FDA. In the European Union, approval means that the EMA has recommended the vaccine candidate for approval and the European Commission has granted that approval via marketing authorization.

Over the years, tensions have continued to persist resulting in incidents such as clashes in 1967 and a military standoff in 2017. On May 5th of this year, tensions flared again when Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed along the western border. A video was shared on social media showing soldiers engaging in fistfights and stone-pelting. Indian media claims that 72 Indian soldiers were injured in the incident. On May 10th, near the disputed eastern border, Chinese soldiers crossed over and shouted at Indian forces, telling them the area didn’t belong to them. This escalated to violence and 11 soldiers were injured. On May 24th, 1000 Chinese forces crossed 2-3km into territory that India claims is theirs. India has also sent troops to the area, and it appears the standoff is ongoing with both sides continuing to fortify their positions.

In 2020, will we see a similar situation where law enforcement use live ammunition to intentionally shoot unarmed protesters? For the purposes of this question: ""Unarmed"" is defined as ""not carrying a weapon that requires a license in the US"". Notably, protesters who throw rocks, water bottles, or other debris at law enforcement, or who start fires, are considered ""unarmed"". Protesters who use vehicles which require a license to operate as weapons will be considered ""armed"" (e.g. if a protester intentionally drives their car into a crowd). If protesters use weapons which do not fit into the above described categories, they are considered ""armed"" only if moderators consider using live ammunition to be a proportionate response. (E.g. if a protester attacked law enforcement with a machete, live ammunition may be a proportionate response, but not if they attack with pepper spray.) If law enforcement is firing upon armed protesters, and unarmed protesters are caught in the crossfire, that would not satisfy this question. Law enforcement must use live ammunition for the purpose of this question. If a protester is killed using ""less than lethal"" ammunition (e.g. rubber bullets), that would not satisfy. Law enforcement must intentionally fire at protesters. Accidental discharge or a ""warning shot"" which does not injure anyone do not satisfy this question. If facts are disputed, the standard of evidence shall be one which would consider the Kent and Jackson State killings to satisfy this question. (E.g. if there are credible investigations which conclude that the protesters were unarmed, then that event would satisfy this question, even if other reports claim that protesters were armed, and the standard of evidence is not strong enough to press legal charges). Moderators will determine whether an investigation is ""credible"". A protestor is a person who is participating in an organized public demonstration of disapproval. If someone is killed as collateral damage (e.g. they happen to be near other protesters when shot, even though they were not protesting themselves), that will satisfy this question. If someone is credibly found to have been pursued by law enforcement for reasons unrelated to the public expression of disapproval, that will not satisfy this question, even if they are near a protest.

Pictures in the news shows people crowded together, most not wearing masks. Health officials have cautioned against attending large meetings such as this out of concerns for spreading Coronavirus. Many people believe it is foolish. So how are we to define ""a spike""? How many of those 6,200 attendees have to get Coronavirus to declare it a ""spike""? Lets consider some simplistic statistics, Oklahoma has a population of about 3,957,000. COVID cases are spiking in Oklahoma, reporting 1,392 new cases from June 17-20. If we apply those numbers to the rally, we might expect 1,392/3,957,000 * 6,200 = 2.18 new COVID cases among the 6,200 attendees of the rally. Will Donald Trump's Tulsa Oklahoma rally on June 20 result in a spike of COVID-19 cases? To be resolved positively reports by a health authority, NY Times, Washington Post, ABC, NBC, PBS, CBS or Fox must report that more than 19 persons likely became infected with COVID by attending the Tulsa rally on June 20.

Adam Garfinkle writes, Singapore is a “managed” democracy, and let’s be frank about what that means: The opposition is not going to win political power short of pigs flying and the moon audibly whistling “Majulah Singapura.” The system is subtly but effectively rigged—I mean protected—against that. One of the ways in which the system is “subtly rigged” is a uniquely Singaporean construct—the “group representation constituency (GRC)”. Introduced in 1988 with the official justification of “enshrining minority representation in Parliament”, it was also criticised as “a ploy to handicap the diminutive Opposition further” as the opposition already found it difficult to attract talented candidates after decades of a single party dominating local politics. Regardless of reason, the opposition never did manage to win a GRC for the first 20+ years since inception; this was only changed when the Worker’s Party (WP) won Aljunied GRC in the 2011 general election. Till date, that (as well as the 2015 general election where WP successfully defended their seats in Aljunied GRC) has been the only time an opposition party has won in a GRC.

1463,Will Planet Nine be discovered by mid-2021?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M4741,"In early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of Planet Nine, a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine. Batygin and Brown's paper, has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Follow-up papers by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an explanation for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it can account for curious orbital commensurabilities among the most distant members of the Kuipier Belt, and it has been hypothesized that it can explain the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator. The planet, however, remains to be found. If it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the use of data from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published an update to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection. It thus seems timely to release this fifth update to our original, now long-closed, Planet Nine question. Specifically: Will the detection (by direct optical observation) of a new Solar System planet occur by July 1, 2021? For this question to resolve as ""Yes"", the new Solar System planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, and an orbital period greater than 5,000 years.",['Physical Sciences – Astrophysics and Cosmology']

During an arrest made by Chauvin and three other officers, he knelt on George Floyd's neck for almost eight minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on a street. The death set off a series of protests around the world. Chauvin was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department the day after the incident. He was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; a charge of second-degree murder was later added. Some have suggested that he will be acquitted of his murder charges. From a Medium post, There are six crucial pieces of information — six facts — that have been largely omitted from discussion on the Chauvin’s conduct. Taken together, they likely exonerate the officer of a murder charge. [...] George Floyd was experiencing cardiopulmonary and psychological distress minutes before he was placed on the ground, let alone had a knee to his neck. The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) allows the use of neck restraint on suspects who actively resist arrest, and George Floyd actively resisted arrest on two occasions, including immediately prior to neck restraint being used. The officers were recorded on their body cams assessing George Floyd as suffering from “excited delirium syndrome” (ExDS), a condition which the MPD considers an extreme threat to both the officers and the suspect. A white paper used by the MPD acknowledges that ExDS suspects may die irrespective of force involved. The officers’ response to this situation was in line with MPD guidelines for ExDS. Restraining the suspect on his or her abdomen (prone restraint) is a common tactic in ExDS situations, and the white paper used by the MPD instructs the officers to control the suspect until paramedics arrive. Floyd’s autopsy revealed a potentially lethal concoction of drugs — not just a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, but also methamphetamine. Together with his history of drug abuse and two serious heart conditions, Floyd’s condition was exceptionally and unusually fragile. Chauvin’s neck restraint is unlikely to have exerted a dangerous amount of force to Floyd’s neck. Floyd is shown on video able to lift his head and neck, and a robust study on double-knee restraints showed a median force exertion of approximately approximately 105lbs. This question resolves positively if Derek Chauvin is acquitted of ALL murder † charges OR all murder charges against him are dropped. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. If he dies before resolution, the question resolves ambiguously. † Only convictions for offences actually called ""murder"" trigger negative resolution ; conviction for other offences such as manslaughter does not.",['Law – Court Cases']

Big pre-trained language models contain a lot of implicit knowledge about the world, however retrieval of that knowledge is not always reliable. These models are also expensive to update with new knowledge, because to do so they would require additional training. One way to address above issue could be augmenting language models with the capability of traditional search engines like Google. An example attempt at this task is the paper REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training utilizing relatively small 330M parameters model. This question asks will a language model with at least 100B parameters trained to do external information retrieval exist before 2023? This question will resolve positive when a language model with at least 100B parameters trained to do external information retrieval will be announced and negative if no such model will be publicly known to exists before 2023. Importantly, the model must have at least 100B parameters and it must be trained by some means to do external information retrieval as in the REALM paper mentioned above.

Adams (born Columbus, Mississippi, October 30, 1964[1] - July 23, 2020) was an American conservative political columnist, writer, author and professor at University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW).[1][2] Recently, in June, it was reported that the university opened an investigation into whether he had lied on his resume: WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Mike Adams has survived multiple calls for his termination. The UNC-Wilmington criminology and sociology professor sued his employer — and won — after the university tried to deny him tenure over public statements that many found to be racist, misogynistic, and homophobic. Some viewed the now-tenured professor as untouchable because of first amendment protections of his free speech, but new questions about his resume - now being refuted by Adams after this story was originally published - could change that. WECT has confirmed the accuracy of some of the information listed on Adams’ resume is, at best, questionable. WECT has further confirmed providing misleading or false information to the university could be a fireable offense under UNCW policy. Yesterday, July 23, 2020, it was reported that he had been found death in his home. The police were vague on the cause: Officials have confirmed the identity of the body but provided no further information about what may have happened. Resolved: did Adams die by suicide?

1486,"Will Three Gorges Dam collapse and kill at least 10,000 people in 2020?","['yes', 'no']",no,M4900,"There is serious concern that China's Three Gorges Dam may fail due to heavy flooding. And that if it fails, it would kill millions of people, perhaps 100 million according to some claims, and displace even more. Up to ~400 million people live downstream of the dam. It would arguably be the biggest non-pandemic disaster in history and have devastating second-order effects, including: exacerbation of the coronavirus, famine, nuclear radiation worse than Fukushima, further instability in Great Power dynamics, and global economic depression/collapse. It is no exaggeration to say that a sudden collapse of this dam could be the spark of cascading civilizational collapse. It is worth examining even if the risk is small. From the National Review: China has been suffering through record rains the past weeks, leading to the worst flooding in the country in decades. There is little relief in sight, and the Yangtze River is now above flood level, according to China’s Ministry of Water Resources. A few days ago, officials admitted that certain “peripheral” structures of the massive Three Gorges Dam deformed due to the building water pressure. Stunning pictures of water being released to relieve pressure are raising the specter of whether the entire dam could fail (some good photos here). Some online satellite photos purporting to show the buckling of the dam, however, should be viewed with skepticism. Still, the damage that has already occurred from the record deluge is significant, with numerous cities upriver from the dam already flooded[...] All that would be dwarfed if the Three Gorges Dam failed. The dam was built from 1994 to 2006, at a cost of $31 billion and displacing 1.4 million people for its construction, precisely to lessen the risk of devastating flooding along the Yangtze, a perennial problem in China since ancient times. The river’s basin accounts for nearly half of China’s agricultural output, and it runs through major cities, such as Wuhan, with 10 million people. Chinese authorities have already evacuated 38 million people downriver. The dam can hold back waters to a level of 175 meters above sea level; according to the Bureau of Hydrology of the Chanjiang (Yangtze) Water Resources Commission, the latest (Friday) height at the dam was 158.85 meters, down from 164 meters on Tuesday. Yet more rain is predicted, and if smaller, older dams upriver from Three Gorges overflow or fail, then the pressure on the main dam could quickly overwhelm either its capacity or even its structural integrity. While an outright failure of the dam may not be the primary danger, nonetheless its geopolitical consequences are staggering to contemplate. It would be a black swan of epic proportions, China’s Chernobyl moment. A tsunami-like wave from a breach in the Three Gorges Dam could wipe out millions of acres of farmland right before the autumn harvest, possibly leading to famine-like conditions. As it is also the world’s largest hydroelectric power station, a failure would lead to huge power outages. Low-lying cities of millions along the Yangtze’s banks cities could become uninhabitable and the death toll could be staggering. See the Effective Altruism Forum for more info and discussion.

1497,Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M5105,"As reported by Al-Jazeera 21st August 2020: Former White House adviser Steve Bannon, an architect of Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, was arrested on a yacht and pleaded not guilty on Thursday after being charged with defrauding donors in a scheme to help build the president's signature wall along the US-Mexico border. The charges were contained in an indictment (PDF) unsealed in Manhattan federal court, which alleges Bannon and three others ""orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors"". The indictment claims the ""scheme"" was related to an online crowdfunding campaign that claims to have raised more than $25m to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. Allsides.com has the various versions of the story across media outlets. The official charges are as follows: BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, and others, orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors, including donors in the Southern District of New York, in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign ultimately known as “We Build The Wall” that raised more than $25,000,000 to build a wall along the southern border of the United States. To induce donors to donate to the campaign, KOLFAGE and BANNON - each of whom, as detailed herein, exerted significant control over We Build the Wall - repeatedly and falsely assured the public that KOLFAGE would “not take a penny in salary or compensation” and that “100% of the funds raised .. will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose” because, as BANNON publicly stated, “we’re a volunteer organization.” Those representations were false. In truth, BRIAN KOLFAGE, STEPHEN BANNON, ANDREW BADOLATO, and TIMOTHY SHEA, the defendants, collectively received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds from We Build the Wall, which they each used in a manner inconsistent with the organization’s public representations. In particular, KOLFAGE covertly took more than $350,000 in funds that had been donated to We Build the Wall for his personal use, while BANNON, through a non-profit organization under his control (“Non-Profit-1”), received over $1,000,000 from We Build the Wall, which BANNON used to, among other things, secretly pay KOLFAGE and to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in BANNON’s personal expenses. To conceal the payments to KOLFAGE from We Build the Wall, KOLFAGE, BANNON, BADOLATO, and SHEA devised a scheme to route those payments from We Build the Wall to KOLFAGE indirectly through Non-Profit-1 and a shell company under SHEA’s control, among other avenues. They did so by using fake invoices and sham “vendor” arrangements, among other ways, to ensure, as KOLFAGE noted in a text message to BADOLATO, that his pay arrangement remained “confidential” and kept on a “need to know” basis. Will Bannon be found guilty of at least one fraud charge? The resolution concerns the first verdict. We may make another question about an eventual appealed case (seems likely). Only the ones in this case are relevant. If Bannon is indicted with unrelated fraud charges, these are irrelevant for this question.",['Politics – US']
1498,Will Uber and Lyft both be operating in California on June 1st 2021?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M5112,"From the BBC, Uber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction. The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday). [...] [Uber and Lyft] have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the ""gig economy"". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft means the firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. [...] There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. ""Your voice can help,"" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. ""Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,"" it said. This question resolves positively if both Uber and Lyft are operating in California on June 1st 2021. Otherwise, it resolves negatively. For the sake of this question, ""operating in California"" is taken to mean that, in at least one city, general consumers can receive Uber and Lyft rides.

Mr. Wallace received high marks for his debut debate in 2016 and is known for his sharp interviewing style. Joe Biden, 77, is the oldest major party nominee in US history, and his opponents have claimed that he is not as mentally sharp as he once was. Indeed, a June 2020 Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that 38% of likely U.S. voters think Biden is suffering from some form of dementia. This has led some to question whether the debates between Trump and Biden could be a turning point in the election campaign. Trump currently (September 4) trails Biden in the 538 polling average by 7.4%; Biden has 50.4% in the polling average, and Trump is on 43%.

1506,Will another paper authored by Phil Rushton be retracted before 2022?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M5219,"There have been many retractions of scientific papers concerning controversial topics in recent times. For instance, earlier this year, Cory Clark et al retracted a much discussed paper (Declines in Religiosity Predict Increases in Violent Crime—but Not Among Countries With Relatively High Average IQ). Similarly, Hans Eysenck has in recent years been facing numerous retraction requests concerning his work with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek on personality and health. Finally, very recently, a paper by Phil Rushton was retracted, Do pigmentation and the melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in other animals?: This article (Rushton, J. P., & Templer, D. I. (2012). Do pigmentation and the melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in other animals? Personality and Individual Differences, 53(1), 4–8. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2012.02.015) has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and the majority of Senior Associate Editors of Personality and Individual Differences and in consultation with the Executive Officers and Board of Directors of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences (ISSID). The reasons given for the retraction were as follows: (1) Rushton & Templer drew on a review paper in an Ecology journal (Ducrest et al., 2008) which argues that genetic variants which influence skin colour may also influence aggression, sexual activity and resistance to stress – mainly based on birds and fish. The correspondent and geneticist each comment that the genes responsible for skin pigmentation in humans are completely different to the genes in these animals. It therefore makes no sense to extrapolate from these animal studies to humans. Ducrest et al. made this crystal clear: “human populations are therefore not expected to consistently exhibit the associations between melanin-based coloration and the physiological and behavioural traits reported in our study”. As the geneticist observes, “the point about genetic variants for skin pigmentation being different in humans makes all the other vertebrate work cited inconsequential”. (2) Rushton & Templer claimed that there are black/white (human) differences in levels of psychopathy. As required of a review paper, the authors should have been aware of a literature showing that black-white differences in the best-available measure of psychopathy are negligible (Skeem et al., 2004). They instead relied on an analysis by Lynn (2002) which has been extensively criticized (Skeem, Edens, Sanford, & Colwell, 2003; Zuckerman, 2003). (3) Rushton & Templer ignored obvious social and educational explanations for higher levels of violence, HIV infection etc. in African and Caribbean countries whilst favouring a genetic theory. (4) Rushton & Templer made several errors when interpreting the results summarised by Ducrest et al. Although relatively minor, these errors consistently favoured their genetic thesis. A detailed writeup of the problems with the paper is available here. Both authors of this paper are deceased (as is Hans Eysenck), so could not address the concerns raised about their work. This question asks: Will another paper authored by Phil Rushton be retracted before 2022? If any additional paper authored by Rushton is officially retracted before 2022, this question resolves positively.

In the case of Warsaw, the required number is 2,132 new cases over 14 days. On Sunday there were already 2,392 of them. Will Warsaw (the capital of Poland) become a red epidemic zone before the 24th of October 2020? For the question to resolve positively the Warsaw district (Warszawa) should be announced as red zone by the government of Poland and the change of the classification must become effective (law has to come to effect, which would mean that increased restrictions must be introduced) before October 24th Central Eastern Time (UTC +2). Typically there is a two day period between the announcement of the status change and the law coming to effect. In case of the unlikely event that Warsaw becomes red zone and still regain its yellow or green zone status before the 24th of October this question would still be resolved positively. The question shall be retroactively closed 12 hours before the official announcement. This is the government website that lists current red districts (under ""Obszary zakwalifikowane jako czerwone (od 10.10.2020)""). Announcements are also made by the twitter of the Ministry of Health","['Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)', 'Short fuse']"

There are growing concerns in the United States that, if he loses the elections, President Donald Trump will not concede and leave office. Trump has publicly declined to commit to accepting the election results. Previous Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has advised Democratic candidate Joe Biden that, if initial results are close, he should not concede on election night, November 3rd. This question asks: Will either Joe Biden or Donald Trump concede in the 2020 US presidential elections by November 17th? This question resolves positively if, at any time between 2020-11-03 (Election Day) and 2020-11-17, either candidate concede that he has lost the 2020 US Presidential Election. They may do this in any venue so long as it is public (e.g. a Tweet will suffice). They may do so using any phrasing (so long as it is sufficiently clear that they have accepted that they will not legally be President on 2021-01-21).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is a novel betacoronavirus that likely emerged late last year from an animal reservoir in China. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against it in the human population. The clinical picture for the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from very mild to fatal. The virus is highly transmissible and has spread globally. As of 22 September 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) is reporting that it is tracking the development of thirty-eight SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines under clinical evaluation. There is an urgent need to determine when the first of these candidates will have been found to have a high degree of efficacy and will have been administered to a significant number of people. The WHO defines vaccine efficacy as follows: Vaccine efficacy: % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions This question asks: Will a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that has demonstrated an efficacy rate >75% in a n>500 RCT be administered to 10M people by March 1st 2021?

Consumer confidence is an important economic indicator, reflecting consumers' optimism regarding the state of the economy and the outlook for their personal financial future. The indicator is tied to people's propensity to spend and save in the near-term. The OECD publishes a Consumer Confidence Indicator on monthly basis. Values over 100 indicate economic optimism, while values under 100 represent pessimism. In January 2020, the CCI in the US was set at 101.57.

While the 'power of veto' is not mentioned by name in the UN Charter, Article 27 grants each of the five permanent member states the ability to veto any 'substantive' resolution. Since the first veto in 1946, the use of the veto power has reflected shifting political balances. Early in the history of the UN, the majority of vetoes were cast by the Soviet Union. From 1970 to 1991, the US cast 56% of the vetoes. In recent years, this balance has once again shifted: China has not cast a lone veto vote since 1999, and has frequently joined Russia in vetoes since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Neither France nor the UK has used their veto power since 1989. Will three or more United Nations Security Council resolutions be vetoed in 2021?

Maguire resigned in 2018 after it was revealed that he had sought inappropriate payments in return for favours to developers. Over the last week ICAC has found that not only did Maguire receive payments from developers in return for favours, he was also involved in a 'cash for visa's scam' targeting Chinese nationals. Ms Berejiklian has not been directly implicated in either scheme. The NSW parliamentary system gives members of the party in government the ability to vote on their leader, and so change the Premier outside of an election. Leaders may also resign and can be removed by the Governor. Over the last 20 years, NSW has had 7 premiers. Of these, 1 was defeated by a leadership spill, 4 resigned, and 1 lost an election.

1532,Will the Supreme Court of the US uphold the lower court's ruling in California v. Texas?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M5445,"From the Kaiser Family Foundation, The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) future continues to be uncertain as the law’s constitutionality will once again be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in California v. Texas (known as Texas v. U.S. in the lower courts). Oral argument is scheduled for Tuesday, November 10, 2020. This ongoing litigation challenges the ACA’s minimum essential coverage provision (known as the individual mandate) and raises questions about the entire law’s survival. The individual mandate provides that most people must maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage; those who do not do so must pay a financial penalty (known as the shared responsibility payment) to the IRS. The individual mandate was upheld as a constitutional exercise of Congress’ taxing power by a five member majority of the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012. In the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), Congress set the shared responsibility payment at zero dollars as of January 1, 2019, leading to the current litigation. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the trial court’s decision that the individual mandate is no longer constitutional because the associated financial penalty no longer “produces at least some revenue” for the federal government. But, instead of deciding whether the rest of the ACA must be struck down, the 5th Circuit sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis. However, the Supreme Court has now agreed to review the case. The ACA remains in effect while the litigation is pending. However, if all or most of the law ultimately is struck down, it will have complex and far-reaching consequences for the nation’s health care system, affecting nearly everyone in some way. A host of ACA provisions could be eliminated, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions, subsidies to make individual health insurance more affordable, expanded eligibility for Medicaid, coverage of young adults up to age 26 under their parents’ insurance policies, coverage of preventive care with no patient cost-sharing, closing of the doughnut hole under Medicare’s drug benefit, and a series of tax increases to fund these initiatives. Will the Supreme Court of the US uphold the lower court's ruling in California v. Texas?

Prior to the 2016 US presidential elections, the latest polling averages indicated that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote versus Republican candidate Donald Trump by a margin of +3.2%. The true margin in the popular vote turned out to be only +2.1% in favor of Clinton. In other words, the disparity between the average margin in the polls and the true margin was 1.1%. As of 15 October 2020, RealClearPolitics.com is reporting an average margin of +9.2% in favor of Democratic candidate Joe Biden over Donald Trump. This question asks: Will polling in the US presidential election miss the true results by 3% percentage points or more? This question resolves positively if the final results of the popular vote indicate a margin between the candidates that is wider or narrower by 3 percentage points or more than the latest available spread according to RealClearPolitics.com.

The guidance contains the following paragraph: Based on current evidence and the measures that schools are already putting in place, such as the system of controls and consistent bubbles, face coverings will not be necessary in the classroom even where social distancing is not possible. Face coverings could have a negative impact on teaching and their use in the classroom should be avoided. This question asks: Will the UK government change its guidance to recommend face coverings in schools before they close? Resolution will be according to official government documentation, such as the link provided in the first paragraph. Words to the effect of ""face coverings are recommended"", or a requirement that pupils and staff must wear face coverings, are required for positive resolution. A change in policy such that it is up to the discretion of schools is not sufficient. The recommendation must be for the use of masks in classrooms. A recommendation that children wear masks in corridors then take them off in lessons is not sufficient.

While his court cases are pending, ProPublica has noted, It’s not likely the recount requests or ballot challenges, which are common in the wake of close elections, will make a difference in the outcome. “Recounts rarely change the vote totals very much,” said University of Kentucky law professor Joshua Douglas, and the same is true of challenges to the validity of ballots. Some have considered the possibility that a disgraced Trump will be dragged out of the White House on inaguration day. Scott Aaronson writes, Now that Trump has gone this far in shattering all the norms of succession, part of me wants to see him go the rest of the way … to being physically dragged out of the Oval Office by Secret Service agents on January 20, in pathetic and humiliating footage that would define how future generations remembered him.

Otherwise, it resolves negatively. A threat of force is constituted by an order by a legitimate authority, such as a Secret Service agent or a judge. In other words, at least one person who has legal authority to forcefully order Trump to leave the White House must order/force him to leave for this question to resolve negatively.

In Early November 2020, a variant strain was identified in Denmark as having an association with mink farming. This led to the immediate cull of all Danish farmed mink (more than 17 million) including breeding stock. On 16 December 2020, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) published a briefing on VUI-202012/01, a variant of SARS-COV-2 consisting of 17 mutations, including N501Y, a mutation in the spike protein. Three days later, in response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new set of national restrictions, including a ""Tier 4"" full lockdown across the southeast, and considerable curtailment of the plans to ease restrictions for 5 days over the Christmas period. It is at least in principle possible that a mutation to SARS-COV-2 could reduce the efficacy of current vaccines. This question asks: Will Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Oxford/AstraZeneca start producing an updated vaccine targeting a SARS-CoV-2 variant before 2023? This question resolves positively if and only if there is a credible media report before 2023 that Moderna, Pfizer, BioNTech, University of Oxford, or AstraZeneca have produced at least one dose of an updated vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Thus, my question is whether the university will declare an Alert Level 4 (sending students home) before May 11 (the final day of the spring semester). Will the University of Pennsylvania send undergraduates back home this semester? The university administration sends out a campus message declaring an Alert Level 4, which closes campus, before the end of the spring semester.",['Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)']
1582,Will the single-dose Johnson & Johnson SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be issued an emergency use authorization by the US FDA before 2022?,"['yes', 'no']",yes,M6548,"The single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine Ad26.COV2.S, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is currently undergoing Phase III testing with the support of Johnson & Johnson. This randomized double-blind Phase III trial, known as ENSEMBLE, has enrolled 45,000 adult participants in multiple countries. On 29 January, Johnson & Johnson reported interim results from the ENSEMBLE trial, which includes 72% efficacy in the US and 66% overall efficacy against moderate to severe COVID-19. On 4 February, Johnson & Johnson announced that it had submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Later on 4 February, the FDA scheduled a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for 26 February 2021. The purpose of the VRBPAC meeting is to have a ""public discussion ... about the data submitted in support of safety and effectiveness of Janssen Biotech Inc.’s COVID-19 vaccine ... help ensure that the public has a clear understanding of the scientific data and information that FDA will evaluate in order to make a decision about whether to authorize this vaccine."" For the two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for which the FDA has already issued EUAs, the EUA was issued the day after the VRBPAC meeting. The VRBPAC meeting on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine occurred on 10 December 2020 and the FDA issued an EUA for it on 11 December. The VRBPAC meeting on the Moderna vaccine occurred on 17 December 2020 and the FDA issued an EUA for it on 18 December. Will the single-dose Johnson & Johnson SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be issued an emergency use authorization by the US FDA before 2022? This question resolves on the basis of an announcement by the US FDA that it has issued an EUA for the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Such an EUA should be issued no later than 31 December 2021.",[]

1584,Will the US implement any of Alex Tabarrok's vaccine suggestions?,"['yes', 'no']",no,M6591,"On Feb 12, Alex Tabarrok wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post advocating for several policies that would speed up vaccinations. A “first doses first” approach — that is, prioritizing first doses by delaying the second shot from three to four weeks (the period studied in clinical trials) to 12 weeks — would allow more people to get vaccinated quickly, for example. “Fractional” dosing, such as by giving half-doses, would instantly increase the vaccine supply and has been used successfully in previous epidemics. Giving the Americans who have already been infected (up to 100 million people) only one shot would help doses go further. It also urges approval of more vaccines. Will the US implement any of Alex Tabarrok's vaccine suggestions? This question resolves positively if prior to Apr 1st, credible reports say that US health officials have implemented any of the following policies from the above op-ed: Approval of Astrazeneca, Novavax, or Sputnik vaccines Half dosing of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines Delaying the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines Giving only one shot to those who have previously recovered from Covid-19",['Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)']

Will the US experience a 4th wave of COVID before June 1, 2021? We define a ""4th wave"" as satisfying both of these conditions: 7-day moving average of daily reported COVID cases in the US experiences a trough to peak increase of 50% or more. the magnitude of the peak in the 7-day moving average of COVID cases in the US is at least 30k. According to the criteria above, the following examples would qualify as ""4th waves"": trough of 30k in 7-day moving average followed by peak of 45k or greater trough of 20k followed by peak of 30k or greater trough of 10k followed by peak of 30k or greater The following examples would not: trough of 30k in 7-day moving average followed by peak of 40k trough of 20k followed by peak of 25k trough of 10k followed by peak of 25k Resolves (retroactively if needed) to ""yes"" on the first date for which both of the above conditions are met according to the CDC.",['Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19)']

Now, while total official deaths surpass 270,000, the country is experiencing a second deadlier wave, with record-breaking COVID-19 deaths per day. Vaccination is still at a slow pace and a new coronavirus variant, P1 (more transmissible and with some chance to evade the immune protection of previous illness), is imposing large stress over the national healthcare system, already close to its full capacity. In view of the above, this question asks: Will Brazil have a 7-day rolling average above 2,500 COVID-19 deaths before 1 June 2021? This question will resolve positively if there is a 7-day rolling average of confirmed COVID-19 deaths equal to or above 2,500 in Brazil before 1 June 2021 according to ourworldindata.
